      "description": "<div>Rambling on about one of my favorite games. Nerd alert.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>It's funny you know, I have this amazing gaming PC at home (my work machine on the other hand is a Mac) and despite it being able to put my xbox 360 to shame I find myself regularly loading up a 2D based RPG released almost 4 years ago by a legendary, though now defunct studio. What has me playing Icewind Dale 2 instead of Oblivion (which is a great game that I still haven't finished)? Party-based gameplay, best of genre strategic combat and the most varied character creation of any game ever released. Years later I still can sit for hours thinking up clever names and picking portrais for my sad band of pixelated hereos.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>I remember seeing Greg give it an 8.3 all those years ago and completely agreeing with the score. It was a great game, but there was virtually no story and even then its Infinity Engine graphics were below par for the time. Neverwinter Nights was released around the same time and IWD2 was seen by the press as this last gasp funeral for people that just couldn't let go of games like Baldur's Gate. NWN and Bioware were supposedly taking us to the future of RPG gaming that would bring the genre to the mainstream. Little did we know that it would be another old-time stuido, Bethesda, that would usher us into that new era with Morrowind and Bioware would start making neutered Star Wars games.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>Since 2002 I have played Morrowind twice, NWN and it's expansions once and Icewind Dale II six times. I have played virtually every single-player PC RPG released in the past 4 years and found that nothing comes close to IWD2's depth or fun factor. Somehow this old \"8.3\" game has provided enough replayability for me to load it up year after year and take a party of 4 to 6 characters (with silly names like \"Kelgar\", \"Dash\" and \"Vicor\") across a bloodied tundra of 40 hours of non-stop fighting.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>At this point I've figured out why I love IWD2 so much and why I've continue to come back to it. The game is both very hard and very fair at the same time. Unlike most hard games you don't feel like the game is cheating you or unfairly assisting its monsters in some way. When you lose in IWD2, you lose because you made a mistake or you weren't thinking about how to attack a situation. This is true regardless of your party's composition, and because of that it is always fun to play. Of the six times I've played it through, I've had a completely different party that needed to utilize different strategies to get through the same difficult scenarios. I've died dozens of times on the famous \"bridge fight\", a battle that finds you flanked on both sides, running out of spells midway through the fight and relying on some clever positioning to keep all your characters alive.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>The best way that I can describe the variety of combat to someone who is used to RPGs, but may not have played IWD2 per se is that in IWD2 your most powerful spells have nothing to do with damage. Although there are a lot of RPGs out there that give you lots of spells most of them end up being worthless; you end up just spamming the high damage spell trying to kill a single character. Not so in IWD2, your most powerful spells are things like sleep, color spray, grease and ray of enfeablement. While you'll use that fireball at some point, it's only after you've neutralized your enemy that you'll even bother to attack them.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>Why is this strategy (which is super fun and stressful) so common in IWD2 but not other games of its type? Simply because in this game its not uncommon to fight over a dozen enemies at a time. If you tried to just attack them you'd be overwhelmed. Unlike Oblivion you can't just run around the arena with your shield up casting fireballs at those 2-3 powerful guys, there's no where to run in this game, the enemies are coming at you in large numbers and there's nothing you can do about it but lay down some debuff spells, hold that holds half of them off and then concentrate your damage at what is now a pretty fair fight.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>The tension and skill you find that comes out of these types of battles is intense, and because your party is always so different with each new game, your way of combatting the situation will always change.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>It's a hell of a ride and one I will likely return to again next year. If you aren't afraid of a challenge and don't mind looking at a bunch of sprites I highly recommend you check it out. That 8.3 might have been true for its time, but like a good wine, Icewind Dale 2 has aged quite well.<\/div>",

      "description": "<p>There\u2019s something to be said for single-minded purpose in game design. Gauntlet Legends is a perfect example to be used in the argument, no matter on which side you might be. It\u2019s an unapologetic dungeon crawler. You hack. You slash. You level up. It doesn\u2019t aspire to do anything more. It may not do a whole lot but don\u2019t take that to mean it\u2019s not worth playing. It does what little it does do very well and if you\u2019re looking for a hack-and-slash RPG in the classic sense, this would be a fine choice - especially if you have some friends wanting to join.<br\/><br\/>Gauntlet Legends is revolves around the story of a big bad demon named Skorne, who was summoned by an eager young mage long ago but then turned on his new master and spread 13 runes across\u2026ah, who cares? The story in Gauntlet Legends serves no purpose other than to provide you with a bad guy to fight at the end and a bunch of little bad guys to fight along the way. You fight those bad guys in four different worlds with about 5-7 stages in each world. Each of the worlds is certainly distinct from one another but the stages within those worlds tend to bleed together.<br\/><br\/>You fight as one of the four characters from the original Gauntlet: the warrior, archer, valkyrie, and wizard. There really isn\u2019t much of a difference between them, though. Each plays about the same way with main variance between them being how the characters\u2019 attacks look. They also have slight stat difference but too slight to make a difference. The highlight of each character is their power attacks - devastating attacks that recharge as you play. These impressive attacks annihilate everything on screen (and off-screen if you\u2019re lucky) with matching visual flair. A number of items spice up combat instead of a variety of moves. There are amulets to strengthen basic attacks, multi-shot items to proliferate your ranged attacks, and hourglasses to stop time. The items are a blast to use and who doesn\u2019t like growing huge like Apache Chief and obliterating some dudes?<br\/><br\/>Legends looks alright but it\u2019s nothing special. The aforementioned power attacks look fittingly impressive but can cause some slow-down when used if the screen is filled with enemies. The catch is that the attacks are most often used when the screen is full of enemies. Oh well, can\u2019t have everything I guess. Some environment textures can be pretty blurry as well but the player characters are better detailed.<br\/><br\/>And with Gauntlet Legends, the more of those characters being used, the better. This game thrives on co-op play. The arcade roots of the game have obviously remained intact on the transfer to consoles. It\u2019s at its best when you\u2019re stomping through a few levels full of demons with three of your buddies.<br\/>What\u2019s on display with Gauntlet Legends might seem too simplified for some, but that really is the game\u2019s strength. It\u2019s single-minded, it knows it, and it does well the one thing it sets out to do. It doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the dungeon crawler but that\u2019s not a bad thing in this instance. It\u2019s a great example of the genre and easily recommendable to anyone looking to knock around zombies, lizards, and skeletons with some friends.<br\/><br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>The last and best of the MVP Baseball Series, MVP 2005 represents a spit-shine of the franchise. Due to the Take-Two third-party exclusivity agreement with the MLB, EA\u2019s brand of baseball ends with this installment. It\u2019s a shame really. Growing out of the Triple Play series, MVP has come to represent some of the best in simulation baseball. <br\/><br\/>The main new features for this installment are Owner\u2019s Mode, mini-games, and Hitter\u2019s Eye. Hitter\u2019s Eye is a system to tell what kind of pitch is being thrown before the ball actually leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand. This is done through the ball flashing different colors corresponding to a specific pitch, as in white for fastball, red for curveball, etc. Hitter\u2019s Eye really doesn\u2019t have much of an effect on the gameplay, however. It can occasionally offer a good tip while on offense but I often found myself paying little to no attention to it. <br\/><br\/>Owner\u2019s Mode is an addition that fans of the series have been clamoring for since 2003. Its absence from MVP 2004 was certainly conspicuous due to the inclusion of similar modes in other EA Sports titles, like Madden 2004. Owner\u2019s Mode gives complete control of an organization to the player by allowing them to build their own stadium, hire\/fire staff, set ticket and concession prices, run promotional giveaways, and other decisions that the suits behind baseball teams make. All of this is stacked on top of the existing Dynasty Mode framework, resulting in an exceptionally deep season mode. It\u2019s also fun on top of being deep. Building your team and making money (even if it\u2019s fake) becomes very satisfying and addicting. The mode can become entrenched in micro managing, however, resulting in too much time navigating menus and not enough time on the field. Also, beginning with a major league team in a minor league ballpark is just kind of weird.<br\/><br\/>The mini-games may seem, at first glance, to be a throwaway addition. In fact, they contain some of the most fun to be had in MVP 2005. The batting mini-game consists of a field with various ramps and obstructions placed on it. You receive points based on the distance of your hits. On top of that, each pitch is delegated a certain part of the field to be hit to and, sometimes, a fly ball or ground ball trajectory. The pitching mini-game is basically a baseball version of Bejeweled. The strike zone is divided into a series of rectangles, each with a color. That color corresponds to a certain pitch and the player receives points for throwing the correct pitch in the right location, with larger groups of rectangles rewarding more points. The mini-game has timed and untimed varieties, of which the timed version is superior due to its gleefully frantic nature. Both of the mini-games offer a surprising amount of fun and can also affect gameplay by being used as stat-boosting activities during Spring Training of Dynasty\/Owner mode.<br\/><br\/>Gameplay-wise, MVP 2005 doesn\u2019t stray far at all from the 2004 iteration. This is a very good thing. The unparalleled amount of control given to the player previously still remains unparalleled.\u00a0 Small tweaks have been made to pitching (a more forgiving pitch meter), baserunning (more difficult stolen bases), and hitting (the ability to move around in the box and the inclusion of foul tips), but the core game has remained intact. Pitching still consists of the golf swing meter used to determine pitch speed and accuracy. A small tweak has been made this year, however, by making the sweet spot of the meter slightly wider in order to be more forgiving. Hitting remains based on timing and the direction the analog stick is pushed. Fielding and baserunning keep the diamond-based button layout with throwing using a simplified swing meter. Everything adds up to result in some of the best gameplay conventions in the business. <br\/><br\/>Graphically, MVP 2005 looks excellent. The many player models look authentic. Star players each have individually modeled life-like faces with a number of generic, but still well done, faces filling in for everyone else. Player bodies, thankfully, look in line with reality with no players looking so pumped full of \u2018roids they could explode. Stadiums, as well, look authentic with notable landmarks like the fountains of Kaufmann Stadium looking lovely. But animations are the star of the show when it comes to MVP 2005\u2019s graphics. Everything benefits from the inclusion of thousands of new animations, particularly hitting and fielding. Hitters react realistically in the batter\u2019s box following swings and foul tips. Instead of returning right back to their stances like some kind of batting robot, hitters will get mad at themselves after bad swings and mosey about after foul tips. Strikeouts are another showpiece for the animation, with appropriately dejected or angered reactions. Fielders have a wide range of ways to make plays on the diamond because of the variety of animations. Diving stops and leaping grabs? Yep. I\u2019ll-get-to-it-when-I-feel-like-it plays? Yes\u2019m. Sunday hops to infielders? Uh-huh. Each of these plays is then followed by an assortment of throwing animations. Game after game, you can still see new plays happening in the field. In short, the players move like baseball players are supposed to move.<br\/><br\/>In the audio department, all the sounds of baseball are present. EA Sports has done a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of the ballpark with everything from the hecklers to the hot dog vendors. On the field, the crack of the bat and the smack of the ball in the glove sound very genuine. The main knock against the audio presentation is the commentary. The duo of Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow do a passable job of play-by-play commentary but it\u2019s nothing to write home about. Kupier reacts similarly to most plays, be it a single through the hole or an inside-the-parker. He remains relatively flat and unenthusiastic throughout. Krukow provides much needed contrast to Kuiper by offering some animated color commentary. Often he\u2019ll get so excited that his voice even seems to break. Another gripe against the commentary, aside from Kuiper, is the repetition of phrases like \u201cthis guy\u201d or \u201cthat player\u201d instead of using player names. It begins to stick out like sore thumb after awhile.<br\/><br\/>MVP 2005 supports online play, as well, save for the GameCube version. There isn\u2019t really much to say about it other than it\u2019s online baseball. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get; though, it does boast some nice features like custom rosters and tourneys. The quality of the online play really depends on the quality of your and your opponent\u2019s connections. Bad connections can lead to borderline unplayable games and certainly not enjoyable ones.<br\/><br\/>MVP Baseball 2005 is one of the best baseball simulations around, even still to this day. Games since its time have looked prettier and flashier; none have played better.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Need for Speed: Most Wanted acts as an injection of freshness that the series needed after the Underground games. Those games, and other franchises, have stretched the tuner scene pretty thin. They also lacked any real police presence, a key feature of earlier series entries and an omission that didn\u2019t do the games any favors. This latest iteration rectifies that mistake and puts a good foot forward for the new generation of consoles.<br\/><br\/>In Most Wanted, you play as a no-name racer in Rockport taking on the Blacklist, a collection of the 15 most notorious street racers in the city. The game starts off with you taking on Razor Callahan, who occupies the 15th spot. But it\u2019s never a fair fight. Razor\u2019s cronies mess with your car before the race causing you to not only lose the race, but lose your car and get arrested to boot. You\u2019re back in the saddle soon enough, though, with help from a woman named Mia. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>The incredible FMV cutscenes scattered throughout the game are also introduced at the beginning. These cutscenes aren\u2019t incredible for their visual panache (though they do sport a cool look by combining live actors with CG backgrounds) but instead because of their performances. The acting on display here would put William Shatner to shame. The characters are so absolutely chomping down on the scenery that you can\u2019t help but laugh. Whether it\u2019s intentional or not, it\u2019s still hilarious. However, most of the story is conveyed through text and voice messages from the various characters for the remainder of the game. These contain a good amount of hamming themselves; nevertheless, the cutscenes take the cake.<br\/><br\/>The game\u2019s career mode sprawls out from there. You\u2019re tasked with taking down Razor, and since he\u2019s now #1 on the Blacklist, everyone else along the way. You accomplish this by beating each member of the Blacklist in races, but you first must prove yourself worthy to face them by completing a number of other challenges. These include driving game staples like circuit, sprint, drag, and knockout races. Checkpoint races are present in the form of tollbooth races and speed trap races place a number of radar guns around the track that clock your speed with the racer with the highest total combined speed at the end of the race winning.<br\/><br\/>Besides the races, you have to reach milestones involving the game\u2019s biggest adversary \u2013 the cops. These range from getting a set number of cops involved in a chase to accruing an overall bounty through various illegal acts. Police can get involved both during and outside of races. However, chases outside of races are where the real fun is. They begin small, with only a few squad cars, but as your heat level rises, the big guns get rolled out. Spike strips, roadblocks, helicopters, and federal Corvettes start bearing down on you. At this point, eluding them can get pretty complicated, requiring you to get and stay out of sight. Oftentimes, just when you think you\u2019re safe, a patrol car will come screeching around the corner to blow your cover. It\u2019s maddening and nerve-racking and thrilling all in one.<br\/><br\/>The core racing through which all this takes place, for the most part, is fun. The computer tends to keep races close by exhibiting some rubber band tendencies. However, this isn\u2019t as detrimental to the game as it might initially seem. In fact, it accentuates the experience, especially when the police are involved. There\u2019s more bumper-to-bumper racing in those situations than you\u2019ll see in any driving game. But it can be annoying near the end of races when the computer immediately pounces on little mistakes, making you start the whole thing over again, but the trade-off is worth the gripes.<br\/><br\/>The graphics of Most Wanted go a long way to enhance the experience through detailed car models and a good sense of speed. The varied environments in the city of Rockport and flashing police lights reflect off car models in convincing fashion. But sometimes all the visual flash can be too much and causes the game to stutter. It\u2019s not a huge problem but it certainly detracts from the visuals. The audio portion of the game is largely excellent. The aforementioned voice performances are great, at least depending on your viewpoint. Engine roars and tire squeals are high quality too. But the police chatter is, by far, the highlight. It makes you wonder if they just stuck a microphone up to a police scanner; it sounds that genuine. Meanwhile, the music that accompanies the gameplay is rather generic. A lot of hip-hop and rock with some techno mixed in for good measure plays in the background, but a decent chase-y theme kicks in when the fuzz get involved.<br\/><br\/>Need for Speed: Most Wanted doesn\u2019t do everything perfectly. But it does most things very well. Especially the police sections, and that\u2019s a good thing given that putting \u201cMost Wanted\u201d in the title without nailing the police chases would be inexcusable. All in all, this game offers more thrills than most racing titles and is certainly worth checking out.<br\/><br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Grand Theft Auto in my eyes is one of the best game series of all time and is destined to be a classic remembered twenty years down the road and beyond. It was to my great joy that Grand Theft Auto IV was hinted at some three years ago and what a journey has it been. Thankfully on Tuesday, April 29th 2008 the game I waited oh so long for finally came out after a couple of mind numbingly annoying delays. I had huge expectations from this game as it garnered the first 10 from Gamespot and IGN in a decade and had critical acclaim from media outlets that had previously bashed it. Let me just say that my expectations of an amazing game were not just met but were shattered. This truly is the best Grand Theft Auto game of all time and it truly earns the first perfect review I have given. <br\/> Let's start off with one of the highlights of GTA IV, the wonderful graphics. I have never been so amazed by a games graphics in all my life. This game literally was the first game to make me say, \"Wow\" when I first feasted my eyes upon it. The game has some very technologically proficient graphics courtesy of the RAGE engine upon which it is based. For the first time in GTA history the characters function as life like humans, each finger has its own motions, the characters express a variety of facial expressions, and the world is living and breathing. The water has also become beautiful in its own right and of course Liberty City is one of the most beautiful landscapes ever rendered into a game. The sheer amount of detail that was put into cars and civilians simply is amazing. The cars look in my opinion near life like and look as good as the cars in any racing game, and that's not even the main focus of the game. The car damage has been vastly improved as well to make it more realistic. The civilians and other people in the environment look just as great as Niko and I have yet to see the exact same person twice. The city is a living and breathing metropolis. Perhaps the most amazing graphical achievement I have seen in this game is the explosions and gunplay. Every bullet hole is seen on a wall and gunfights just look great. Shooting up cars now displays to you cracked window shields with blood in the cracks and it just looks good. The explosions are the highlight of the graphics in my opinion, each one is amazing and the smoke bellows and the fire send an inferno within a large radius. These truly are mind shattering explosions. The physics engine is really put to use, for instance blowing up a police car with five officers around it will send all the police flying in different directions flailing and screaming for their lives. It's just satisfying and brings a new sense of realism and is an amazing achievement in the game. <br\/> As far as game play goes Grand Theft Auto IV has fixed and changed many things about the game, despite these changes though the game still has the unique feel of a Grand Theft Auto game and not something totally different. Perhaps the most important game play change to mention is the new and redone combat system. Apart from improved aiming Rockstar has also added in a cover system. All of this works very well and it's a blast to get into gunfights knowing the combat will be seamless and easy to get the hang of. I have never had a problem with combat though I understand some people have. I don't blame them for having these problems but I think what they complain about is trivial. The combat system still has slight room for improvement but it is much better this time around and I really had a lot of fun. The melee combat is also a lot different now as it is far more complex and deep but still a lot of fun. It has made the melee combat a lot more fun and a lot more brutal. Another excellent game play element is the cell phone which is probably the best new feature in the game. I absolutely love this thing; you can arrange dates with your friends, take pictures, play multiplayer, and take calls from mission givers. It's just a great feature and feels seamlessly integrated into the game. It doesn't feel tacked on but rather it feels as if it's always been apart of GTA. In a sense it has as cell-phones were used in the past in Vice City and San Andreas but never to this level of depth. The other new features in the game play are all great but somewhat negligible to mention as they don't add a lot to change the experience but certainly if you access them they make the game a blast. Some of these include being able to go to comedy clubs and cabaret clubs which are amazingly funny and entertaining. <br\/> The sound of Grand theft Auto IV is top notch. The soundtrack in my opinion is amazing and Rockstar really did a good job of using licensed music in the cut scenes and to set mood. The radio stations are all great and I was happy to see Rockstar taking risks with the types of music they chose to put in. This soundtrack is my favorite yet as it didn't distract me like it did in previous Grand Theft Auto games but rather made me feel more into the game. It was also great to hear plenty of new music I never heard before. Unlike San Andreas or Vice City where I heard it all before Grand Theft Auto IV allowed me to hear plenty of new stuff that I surely enjoyed. The script is also top notch; the dialogue is snappy, smart, and funny. Niko is the most real character yet thanks to his dialogue and the other characters are brought to life through excellent writing and excellent voice work. One notable change in the voice work was no celebrities were brought in this time around unlike in other Grand Theft Auto games. This is a welcome change and I didn't miss them one bit, the voice actors in the game were amazing and I thought they did a better job then any of the Hollywood actors did in the past. The sound in the game is of the highest quality and should be a bar that all games should shoot for. <br\/> Grand Theft Auto IV is in my opinion simply the best game ever made. Previous to it my favorite game of all time was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas but this game easily tops it. It highly deserves a ten score and all the critical acclaim it has garnered from various publications. Its value is excellent, the single player clocks in at around 50-60 hours with all the side missions you can do and the multiplayer lasts forever with 15 modes to play around with. This is a game I will have fun with for a long time and I am glad I bought it opening day. Paying 60 dollars for this game is a steal of a price as it is worth a ton more. Buying this game isn't a choice but rather an obligation at this point as this is quite possible the best game I have ever played, hears waiting for Rockstar's next entry into the Grand Theft Auto series. In the meantime I'll be playing Grand Theft Auto IV until my eyes fall out, simply outstanding from start to end.<\/p>",

      "deck": "MGS4 blurs the line between cinematography and gameplay. ",
      "description": "<div class=\"content lh16 cl pb10\">Metal Gear Solid has always been praised (and sometimes bashed) by it's long cutscenes, movie-style cinematography and mind bending plot twists. Metal Gear Solid 4 continues this trend by not only reaching this goal, but by blasting it into hyper-space. But what hasn't been done well in a Metal Gear Solid game is a perfect control system, an in-depth and varied gameplay and intense action, to which Metal Gear Solid 4 not only improves upon these elements, but perfects them.<br\/><br\/>Snake's final chapter begins in the Middle East, and he is tasked with the extermination of Liquid. With nanomachines controlling and surpressing soldiers emotions, and Snake's curiously rapid aging, you know things are going to go horribly wrong from the beginning, which leads to Snake jetting off to South America, Europe and some other exotic and not-so-exotic locales. All loose ends get tied up in MGS4, such as the FoxDie virus, the mysterious Patriots and the fates of characters like Raiden, Rose, EVA, Vamp and Meryl Sliverburgh being some examples.<br\/><br\/>If you couldn't make sense of the above paragraph, then MGS4 is certainly not the game for you, as it has a convulted story that doesn't require you to have played previous games, but it sure helps a hell of a lot. Even with the fantastic gameplay, if you didn't like Metal Gear because of it's story before, then Metal Gear Solid 4 isn't going to change your mind.<br\/><br\/>But if you are one of the many that enjoys Metal Gear Solid for it's story, then the fantastic gameplay is no longer an optional extra. The gameplay is now an integral, exciting and, most importantly; fun part of the game. With new additions such as the Octocamo, a suit that changes it's colour and texture based on the surface Snake is pressed up against, and the Metal Gear Mk. II, sneaking around the environment has never been more fun.<br\/><br\/>But if you're the type of person to go in gun-ho, then you're not punished by it, and in some cases, rewarded for it. Not only does it offer a nice change of pace to sneaking, it can net you some Drebin Points (a form of currency used to buy and upgrade weapons) and you can ally yourself with the local militia, who are intent on taking down Liquid's private army.<br\/><br\/>All of this looks and sounds fantastic. War-torn buildings and gritty textures populate the Middle Eastern setting, lush jungle environments with towering trees and beautiful rivers reside in other countries. With the sound of bullets whizzing past Snake's head, pummeling explosions and heart-stopping gunshots, you'll need to remind yourself that you're not playing a movie.<br\/><br\/>MGS4 is one for the fans, but newcomers will find something they like. Although it has little replay value, and some may find Kojima's trademark humour a little tasteless, Metal Gear Solid 4 is an epic, action-packed, heart-pounding experience. Though there are some parts of the game that you are guaranteed to dislike, the clever boss battles, and some intense on-rails sequences will surely win you over. <\/div>",

The story here is a alien race invades earth typical for a sci-fi game. The game starts out slow. You are in prision for an untold reason and is \"liberated\" by your comrades. You start off by either picking traning. (which i recomnd your do) or go straight to battle. The enviroments are PRETTY..Best graphics ive seen so far on my 360. Gameplay is usually fast and tactical..Hiding and firing from cover our you can rush the enemy with your chainsaw attached to your gun. Sounds are amazing. Great voice overs done by actors. The game is 59.99 and 69.99 for collectors edition but the game is worth it. I recmond all 360 owners get this game. If you like Really fast paced games probley not for you but if you like a mindless killing from behind cover kind of game then this is perfect for you. There are some collision issues. SO if you can get past those there the game is amazing. <\/p>",

      "deck": "Mario Kart Wii is more Mario Kart, no more, no less.",
      "description": "<p>In 1992, the Mario Kart series was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Since then, it has become one of Nintendo\u2019s most popular series, along with Zelda, Metroid and the Mario series in general. The Kart series has made the racing genre much more accessible for everyone. Over the years, the series has been fine-tuned while still retaining its easy-to-pick-up play style. Now, with the introduction of the Wii and the motion-sensor controller, the Mario Kart series continues, and guess what? It\u2019s more Mario Kart.<br\/> <br\/> As previously mentioned, the Mario Kart series has been around since 1992 and since then, has grown to six games (eight if you count the arcade GP games.) With this many games out, the series is bound to repeat itself in a few areas, and for the most part, that\u2019s fine. The Mario Kart series is known for it\u2019s ability to be played with friends on the same console, which means there\u2019s always plenty of fun to be had. Each Rainbow Road is as difficult and exciting as the last, and even unlocking the characters by yourself can be interesting enough to keep you playing for quite some time.<br\/> <br\/> But this time around, Mario Kart Wii just seems like more of the same. As mentioned before, while this isn\u2019t a bad thing overall, returning players will notice a lot of the same tricks and tracks designs from previous games. Some tracks almost feel like the same track from a previous game, but with a different theme and looked at through a mirror. While it\u2019s not expected that each track be completely original and unique, it just feels like the designers copy and pasted a few tracks.<br\/> <br\/> While some of the tracks may give a feeling of deja vu, there are 32 of them to pick from, so at least there\u2019s a large selection. 16 of the tracks are new, while the other 16 are from previous Kart games. While the ability to choose is nice, some of the \u201cretro\u201d tracks that were selected aren\u2019t all that popular from the previous games, so there isn\u2019t much of an incentive to play them a second time around, since they weren\u2019t all that great the first time around.<br\/> <br\/> That being said, the retro tracks haven\u2019t come in untouched. While many of the tracks (mainly the SNES\/GBA tracks) have been translated into 3D, most of the previous 3D tracks feature some new additions to make them more in tune with the new additions in Mario Kart Wii. But while they have been modified slightly, the tracks will still look and play just as you remember them.<br\/> <br\/> In addition to the 32 tracks, there are 25 playable characters in Mario Kart Wii, most of which you\u2019ll have to unlock. Doing so is a great example of the kind of audience that the Kart series caters to. For some of the characters, you must simply finish the Grand Prix modes and finish in the top three. But for others, you must complete tasks that most Kart players wouldn\u2019t even consider completing, which means there is a nice reward for the hardcore Kart players.<br\/> <br\/> While Mario Kart Wii may cater very well to the hardcore player, it also tries to maintain it\u2019s pick-up-and-play mechanics, which doesn\u2019t cross over very well in a number of different ways. Especially in the 150CC races, the items become ridiculous, knocking a first place racer all the way down to 12th in a matter of seconds. Even though this may work to the players advantage, it mainly gives the AI the upper hand, since they have a greater chance of being behind you.<br\/> <br\/> Even with the item problems, the algorithm behind the selection can seem off at time, especially during 1-on-1 races. Even though the player in second place is technically in last place, the game still gives them items as if they were in second place, giving them little or no chance to catch back up. This can become frustrating, especially if the gap between the players is quite large, making your defeat almost imminent.<br\/> <br\/> On the topic of multiplayer, the Mario Kart Wii still retains the great local multiplayer that the game is known for. However, Battle Mode is now broken down into two teams, and when these games are taken online, they\u2019re played on maps built for 12 players, rather than the four that are allowed. Also, when playing with three or more people on one console, the game cuts its frames-per-second in half, making it look not nearly as smooth as when one or two people are playing.<br\/> <br\/> Outside of local multiplayer, online play has been introduced to the console Kart games, and it\u2019s a vast improvement over previous Nintendo titles. Games begin quickly, and there is virtually no lag at all. You can race worldwide, in your country only or simply against a few friends. The friend code system is still in place, which means you\u2019ll have to swap codes if you want to play with friends, but the whole experience is so much quicker and easier than previous attempts, that it can almost be overlooked.<br\/> <br\/> In addition to playing online, there is also a new Mario Kart channel for your Wii that comes with the game. It contains leaderboards and stats from yourself and all of your friends. You can compare time trial scores, along with simply spectate current online matches. The channel works without the disc, which makes keeping up with the game rather simple.<br\/> <br\/> Another thing that comes with the game is the wheel, which is one of the main draws of the new Kart. Most of the previous racing games make use of the Wii remote itself, but this time around, Nintendo has included an accessory that makes the experience that much more authentic. Along with the wheel, players can use the Gamecube\/Classic Controller, along with the Wii remote and nunchauk. It\u2019s all up to your preference, but the new wheel works just fine, especially since it comes free with the game.<br\/> <br\/> The last large addition to Mario Kart Wii is the introduction of tricks, not to mention motorcycles. The trick system is quite easy, and gives players a short boost when they land one. There are jumps all over the courses to ensure that players will make full use of this system, especially when it comes to 150CC.<br\/> <br\/> Also, bikes have been added into the series, and they feel completely natural. While karts can receive a second \u2018level\u2019 speed boosts, bikes can pop a wheelie on straightaways and recieve a slight increase in speed. Also, drifting is no longer determined by players jiggling their joysticks, which eliminates \u2019snaking\u2019, giving new players a much better chance at winning online against experience players.<br\/> <br\/> Aesthetically is where Mario Kari Wii shines the least. It doesn\u2019t look much better than the version before it, and even the bystanders in stands, who consist of Miis from your console, are rendered in 2D, which shouldn\u2019t really even be an option at this point. While a few details have been fine tuned, and the game itself runs very smooth, it just isn\u2019t a large enough step ahead to be considered up-to-par. Audio-wise, Mario Kart Wii sounds like every Kart game before it, although the character sayings do begin to feel repetitive after landing tricks over and over.<br\/> <br\/> Overall, Mario Kart Wii is more Mario Kart. No more, no less. The addition of online play is a nice addition, and in itself is worth getting the game for. So in the end, it comes down to one question: do you like Mario Kart? If the answer is yes, then pick up Mario Kart Wii, because it stays very true to the Kart formula and has plenty of replay value, but don\u2019t expect to be amazed. If no, then I would still recommend looking into it. It\u2019s a great game, and definitely a must own for the Wii owner who loves to party.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Ice chunks form on all sides of your ship, commanding all the attention of your crew for the task at hand. The quota has to be filled, but your boat also needs to stay afloat, so your crew is safe from your wrath\u2013for now. After the ice has been cleared from the boat, you and your crew get to the real task at hand: fishing for crabs. Don\u2019t get too excited, but don\u2019t get too cynical either.<br\/><br\/> <\/p><p>It\u2019s hard to sell a game about crab-fishing to groups of gamers that are used to action-packed games like Halo 3 or Metal Gear Solid 4. At first glance it seems akin to offering vegetables to child. Why would a testosterone-fueled 18-34 male want a game about fishing? Short answer is that Mr. 18-34 probably doesn\u2019t. But a deeper look into the game reveals surprising depth for gamers out there that want to step back from action and have a more chilled experience.<\/p> <p>After a lengthy tutorial gets you acclimated to controlling the boats, you\u2019re not ready to set sail for the Bering Sea quite yet. Crew members must be hired and provisions (bait, gas, fishing pots) must be purchased. With fresh supplies and an experienced crew, you plan out your fishing strategy. Checking your plotter, a device that allows you to check crab population, you map out your strategies to hit areas with the highest density. Marking your map with your planned strings, (swaths of sea where you drop your pots to \u201csoak\u201d) you and your crew make haste for that location. Once there, your crew gets to work, as do you. Getting the boat into position, you ring a buzzer, giving your workers the green light to drop the pot into the sea. You continue this strategy for a while, and your employees are starting to tire. Yet, you need to get these pots down as soon as possible. Meeting the quota is paramount to any sleeping concerns of these peasants. Not soon after, one of your workers makes an error, resulting in a steel pot being dropped from a crane and onto a fellow employee. The aftermath is not good\u2013the injured employee was your deck boss and your most trusted and experienced crew member., who is now out for the season.The effect is much like a weigh scale. On one of the arms you have the need to meet the quota, and then on the other, the need to protect the safety of your crew. Finding the right balance is the challenge.<\/p> <p>Even with a key crew member down, you\u2019re still able to continue. Completing your fishing strategy, you head back to harbor to find a replacement for your fallen deck boss. Luckily, there are still some unemployed, willing hands, which you promptly hire. Getting back to sea, you begin to retrieve your hauls. The first couple of hauls only bring in a miniscule number of \u201ckeepers\u201d (adult crabs) and it continues along most of your strings. Frustrated, you radio other fisherman to see how they\u2019re haul has been going. Listen closely, because not all of them are looking to help. This particular fisherman tells you that their fishing has gone great, even though they might have been fishing along the same strings you have been. Knowing how the fishing has gone for you, you make note to disregard whatever they say in the future.<\/p> <p>As you\u2019re about to finish picking up the last of your ill-fated pots, something happens. Everything stands still. You figure it\u2019s just a temporary lock-up. Tapping the guide button multiple times proves fruitless, so you reluctantly turn off your 360. It\u2019s just bad luck, and hey, you saved just before the freeze, so everything\u2019s kosher. Minutes later, it happens again. And again\u2026ad nauseam. Progressing through a complete season of crab fishing seems impossible up to a certain point because of the technical difficulties that continue to muck up your experience.<\/p> <p>Glancing at screenshots of the game, shrugging it off as a quick, sloppy cash-in on the TV show would be an easy conclusion. Nothing looks particularly good and there is plenty that looks bad. Hauling in your catch of crab, the detail on the fish passes scrutiny while in the pot. But when dumped into the catching tray for your crew to sort, it becomes this amalgamation of brown slime and gunk that looks laughably bad. Re-creations of the different boats seen on the show are faithful, but technical prowess is something Deadliest Catch does not have.<\/p> <p>Graphical limitations aside, Deadliest Catch is surprisingly competent. In so far as games are vehicles for excitement and action, the game falls on its face. Where it finds its footing is in its unique setup that is unlike anything else on the market. Unique might not mean great or even good, but you could rent much worse.<\/p>",

      "deck": "Sin and Punishment: A Flawed, but Worthwhile Shooter",
      "description": "<div class=\"content lh16 cl pb10\"> With every generation of console games, there are always a few definitive games which, while classics, are never released outside of the land of the rising sun. Up until recently, Sin and Punishment was one such game. Coming out at the tail end of the lifespan of the Nintendo 64, the most exposure it had received until recently was within the hardcore gaming circle, within which it became a rather legendary game. Indeed, Sin and Punishment is yet another worthy shooter from critically-lauded development house Treasure. Although it may have serious issues with the amount of playtime and a lack of real difficulty, the game is otherwise a diamond in the rough which shouldn't be neglected by those of the Nintendo 64 generation.<br\/> <br\/> Superficially, Sin and Punishment is not unlike a lot of Treasure's other offerings. A lot of time is spent simultaneously running and gunning numerous enemies in the hopes of reaching a level's end. In addition, the convention of a small, but memorable cast of characters used to tell most of the game's story is implemented once again. And of course, the battles are of a grand scope. To say that the game is therefore similar to Treasure's past offerings is hardly a stretch. However, it still stands on its own quite well, as it mixes several unique elements to create a brand of on-rails shooting not quite like anything else.<br\/> <br\/> The most emphatic of these elements is that of Sin and Punishment's wonderfully diverse settings. Each stage takes place in completely different areas, which range from underground lava flows to desolate cityscapes to even beaches. To top it all off, every area plays host to epic, large-scale battles with plenty of things happening at any given time. As if that wasn't enough, though, the ways in which the battles are fought, much like the stages, vary from area to area, with each stage playing host to a unique method of doing so. In one moment, players could be fending off beastly bugs and other unsightly creatures by slowly creeping through a New York subway, while another will have them fighting Gunstar Heroes-style in a side-scrolling stage. This flair for individual style in the battles, as well as the usage of completely unique areas throughout the game's entirety, help make Sin and Punishment easily memorable long after finishing it.<br\/> <br\/> What helps the game succeed in those regards, though, can be mainly attributed to the game's graphics. Put simply, without the help of the Nintendo 64's expansion pack, Sin and Punishment is one of the system's best-looking games. Not only does everything look sharp, considering the system's capabilities, but it all holds up very well. As mentioned earlier, there can be plenty of action on the screen and, thankfully, Sin and Punishment's frame rate is up to the job. It stays smooth even in very hectic situations, enabling the action to occur as it was intended. The graphics are also the piece which help make the levels feel cohesive and connected to each other. Even as players switch from one area to the next, the style in the game stays consistent, providing a reminder that, even if some of the gameplay has changed, it's still the same game. Plus, the game actually does a good job of making the scenery just as attractive to look at as the action on the battlefront.<br\/> <br\/> To complement these characteristics, Sin and Punishment's sound design is also unorthodox for a Nintendo 64 game in that it uses a relatively prolific amount of voice acting. It may not be the only game on the console to do so, but it's one of the few where every line of dialog is vocalized. While the quality of the acting itself may be solid at best, the fact that quite a bit of it was crammed into an N64 cartridge is an achievement in and of itself. Oh, it's also in English with Japanese subtitles, as if there weren't enough elements which set the game apart from its brethren as it is. The other parts, the game's sound effects and music, aren't quite as unusual as the voice acting, but they get the job done, if nothing else.<br\/> <br\/> The controls of Sin and Punishment also do a good job at keeping things relatively intuitive. Movement of the characters is done via the d-pad, while the control stick is used for the targeting cursor, the shoulder buttons are reserved for jumps, and the Z-button for shooting, as well as sword swipes for up-close encounters. It's a setup which, while fairly unusual, doesn't take long to get accustomed to and means that little fumbling ultimately takes place. In addition, there are two methods of aiming with the A and B-buttons, one which involves locking onto enemies and the other having manual aiming. Which method is picked affects how much damage each shot does, although that's about as deep as the differences between the two go. <br\/><br\/>If there are areas in which Sin and Punishment could have improved, though, then they are most certainly in the game's difficulty and breadth, or lack thereof of both. The problem with the former is that it's overly easy, especially considering the genre in which it inhabits. Many of the enemies, even the bosses, can be taken down with ease. This is compounded by a liberal dosage of continues and health packs, which ensure that it shouldn't take no more than several tries to pass a stage, should one actually manage to die. For a game which has epic battles throughout the entire story, it just seems odd that the difficulty wasn't upped a few notches. In fact, it's completely possibly to beat the game without ever having to restart from the beginning. It's simply that liberal in its generosity. The bigger issue, however, is in the latter. Getting to the end on the default difficulty doesn't take much longer than an hour, even if the stages themselves don't feel overly brief. Although it ensures that Sin and Punishment doesn't wear out its welcome, the addition of a few more levels could only have been to the game's benefit. Just because the game may feel highly arcade-like in nature doesn't mean Treasure should have felt obligated to keep its time allotment just as meager.<br\/> <br\/> Even with those issues, however, Sin and Punishment is still a game worth playing or even buying. As one of Treasure's few forays on the Nintendo 64, it's an excellent one which does a superb job at showing off the system's capabilities. With a combination of extremely diverse gameplay, great, rock-steady visuals, and voice acting, Sin and Punishment leaves quite a favorable impression that never fades during the brief playtime. It may have some serious problems with difficulty and brevity, but because those are really the game's only hindrances, it still comes out as quite an achievement and as one of the Nintendo 64's most memorable games in its roster. Gamers from that era, as well as on-rails shooter fans, shouldn't hesitate in picking up this gem, regardless of its cultural roots. <\/div>",

      "deck": "Vib-Ribbon: The Charming, if Somewhat Lacking Rhythm Game",
      "description": "<p>The conventions employed by games within the music genre tend to be consistent across the board. Regardless of the catalytic instrument used, the gameplay ultimately boils down to simply matching some rendition of notes and\/or beats with proper timing. In that respect, Vib-Ribbon is no different. However, a quick glance at the vector-style box art should be enough to indicate that Vib-Ribbon is really not that much of a conformist. It's a PlayStation import that not everyone will necessarily be able to enjoy, but those that have the right tastes will find a game whose charm makes up for its deficiencies.<br\/> <br\/> What differentiates Vib-Ribbon from most of the other modern music games on the market can be found in the way in which Vib-Ribbon presents its content. Instead of solely being packaged with pre-programmed songs that are tweaked according to difficulty, the game lets players import any song they please from a music CD. There are indeed several songs from Japanese indie group Laugh&amp;Peace included in the game which serve as introductions to Vib-Ribbon's content, but the vast majority of the value stems from using one's own music collection. Thankfully, Vib-Ribbon does a good job of being able to make its levels from the material with which it is provided. Although the game engine has a tendency to draw upon the bass, it'll also occasionally call upon vocals and other parts to mess around with timing. It's not a completely perfect implementation, but it's still well-done overall and makes the game worthwhile in that respect.<br\/> <br\/> Vib-Ribbon's actual gameplay is probably its most defining characteristic outside of the music importation feature. Whereas other music games simply rely on hand-eye coordination involving abstract symbols, Vib-Ribbon uses the music to generate obstacle courses. The player, as the main character Vibri, has to successfully overcome several types of obstacles by using the shoulder buttons, down on the d-pad, and the X-button. Easy levels only include four different types of obstacles, which consist of a loop, a jagged line, a gap, and a rectangle and crossing them is simply a matter of hitting one of the previously-mentioned buttons correctly. Harder levels, however, also have combination obstacles, which incorporate two types of obstacles. Crossing them is a matter of determining which parts make up the combined obstacle and then hitting the respective buttons. It's an elegant control setup which becomes natural after several play-sessions and, indeed, getting familiar with the nuances of interacting with Vibri's hindrances is a must for harder songs.<br\/> <br\/> All of that is essentially the core gameplay and doesn't change from song to song. However, the inherent difficulty level which certain songs may have can also bring about other mechanics. Faster songs, for example, may make the obstacles rotate while the camera is at a certain angle, which can make timing a tough matter. Other songs, however, may change the speed at which certain obstacles approach Vibri. At one moment, one might expect that a jagged line is the next thing to cross, but a rectangle may actually speed ahead of it and become the next target. The game also changes which direction Vibri is seen running, which is done mainly in intermissions which the game generates during a song to grant the player a small break. (That, however, is something which only shows up in the music CD-generated levels.) If necessary, the game also changes the tempo in timing with the music and makes the shapes move accordingly.<br\/> <br\/> All of these mechanics can make for a harder experience in theory. However, most of them don't tend to pose much of a threat in practice. However, the difficulty can feel somewhat sporadic between songs. While some guesstimating can be done beforehand, it's not set in stone until the game actually starts running. The only indicator which the player receives beforehand is Vibri's pace. But because that takes place just moments before each song actually commences, it's usually too late. Thus, some surprises can show up when trying out different songs. Over the course of testing, there were a few instances where fast piano solos generated harder levels than things such as punk rock riffs. It's not too much of a detraction, but it can still be an unpleasant surprise nevertheless.<br\/> <br\/> On a completely different note, the aesthetics of Vib-Ribbon are among the most unique in the PlayStation's offerings. Instead of colorful sprites or textured polygons, Vib-Ribbon opts for a simple vector-based style. Absolutely everything in the game, save for the development studio's logo, is done entirely with very defined white lines. Because it's a style which has virtually no presence in today's gaming, the meagerness of it doesn't actually hurt the game at all. The visuals also give Vibri a quasi-personality in and of itself, as no rabbit would be typically rendered in the manner that she is. (Depending on how well the player does, however, Vibri may either become something better or worse than a rabbit over the course of the game. Each of these different forms lend their own unique appearance with the vector lines as well.) In the end, it's a very modest graphics engine, but it's sufficient enough to convey what the game wants to get across as well as simultaneously give it plenty of flair to boot.<br\/> <br\/> When considering that the game is a musical one, it should come to no surprise that it tackles that department well. The abstract sound effects and main menu music play just fine, as do Vib-Ribbon's packed-in songs. There also happens to be some very interesting voice acting for Vibri, which is done in jolly and psychedelic manner. Music which is imported from CDs also plays just fine and the audio quality sounds on par with any other CD player on the market. All told, Vib-Ribbon's music and sounds are good and solid, a task which is critical for a game within its respective category.<br\/> <br\/> If there is one main gripe to be had about Vib-Ribbon, though, then it's the fact that the game is devoid of any real depth. The game's entirety consists of jumping over obstacles and listening to music and while those things may have been implemented well, the absence of other things to do robs it of a little value. Although a lot of motivation for playing it can come from seeing how it interprets one's own music, there's otherwise no other real reason to play the game. It's unfortunate in that respect. However, what is there does manage to be compelling and it compensates for that one major fault.<br\/> <br\/> In the end, Vib-Ribbon is one of the more unique music games to have ever been conceived. Although its premise may ultimately be very short and sweet, it's one that is still rarely done in the industry today, let alone done well. Not everyone will necessary like this game for very obvious reasons and the main fault does hurt the game's potential. However, for those who are big music buffs and\/or like their games developed on the more surreal side, Vib-Ribbon is a game worth playing. Just be sure to go into this experience knowing full well what this game has to offer.<\/p>",

      "description": "<div class=\"snap_preview\"><p>Bullets whiz over your prone body as you sneak through the forest. Mortar fire can be heard in the distance, screeching above. The mortar strikes the ground with force, kicking up dust, dirt and debris, eliciting a wince. You keep going\u2013after all, you\u2019ve got a job to do.<\/p> <p>You continue your long, slow crawl through the muck. From the east comes a squadron of militia fighters who do not notice you hiding in some high grass. They push forward while you follow close behind, careful to not arouse suspicion. Soon enough, the rebels begin to engage private military corporation (PMC) troops that are entrenched in their base. Amidst the chaos, you start to circle around the battlefield, but soon find that your initial pathway is cut-off by a machine gun that will surely tear you to shreds if you continue on. Pulling back, you quickly check your map for another way to evade these two factions. Confirming that a hill to the west will do the trick, you slither to your destination, successfully evading all combat.<\/p> <p>Soon after, you\u2019ll meet up with Drebin, a cool, calm, no non-sense kind of guy who will be your supplier of all sort of explosives, weapons, ammunition. Having access to Drebin\u2019s shop will allow you to tailor your battlefield experience a bit. To be sure, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a stealth action game first and foremost, but there are some concessions here for someone who likes to run-and-gun, first and foremost being the tighter controls, while Drebin keeps you supplied with enough ammunition and firepower.<\/p> <p>After purchasing some much needed supplies, you forge ahead. Using your Solid Eye, which allows you to view where enemy forces are, (radar and binoculars) how concealed you are from them, as well as allowing an infra-red option to help you in the darker locales, you spot two PMC soldiers patrolling a road that you need to travel along. Swapping to your tranquilizer pistol, you take aim for the first. A shot to the neck drops him in one fell swoop. His partner turns around, puzzled at the sight of his fallen comrade. Before he gets a chance to investigate, you plug him with two tranquilizer shots\u2026just to be safe. Staring at your pistol, you\u2019re shocked at how easy the controls are than in past missions, and you\u2019re thankful you\u2019re not fighting from an over-head, top-down viewpoint. Laying still, you allow your \u201cOctoCamo\u201d suit to readjust to fit the terrain that you will be traversing up ahead. You move forward. Coming up to another PMC base, you take shelter behind a concrete block. You try to take cover behind it, in the hopes of being able to take pot shots at the enemy, then ducking back down into cover. Sadly, Snake wasn\u2019t equipped with this seemingly basic ability.<\/p> <p>After infiltrating a compound for a person of interest, you make your way around another battlefield. A bulldozer for the now friendly militia (because you did not fire at them in previous parts of the game) is destroyed, slowing your progress to find this \u201cperson of interest.\u201d Destination points on your mini-map direct you to destroy two doors that seemingly lead to where you have to go, though, it is clear after many attempts to bust down the doors that your map is mistaken. Instead, you will have to go elsewhere, as you mutter under your breath about the poor direction. This will not be the only time that poor direction will cause some discomfort, most noticeably when you encounter certain boss characters in the game. Not only poor direction, but an extremely \u201cgamey\u201d cheesiness comes into play during a specific boss encounter, where the solution does not necessarily logically flow. Through persistence, constant Codec calls to Otacon, or through a desperate search of online guides, you\u2019ll eventually find the solution, but wish that the challenge was in the fight, rather than finding a convoluted weak point. This is the weakness of the second half of the game, which is heavier on boss fights and plot, rather than intense battlefield situations. For fans of Snake\u2019s saga, this will not be a problem\u2013for fans of the excellent gameplay that Metal Gear Solid 4 provides, it\u2019s a bit of a let down.<\/p> <p>Inevitably, you\u2019ll stumble into a cut-scene or two, which is where the bulk of the story unfolds. The game represents a wide swath of genres, from action, comedy, drama, romance, science fiction\u2013Metal Gear Solid 4 has it all. In terms of pure cinematic quality, Metal Gear Solid 4 arguably has no equal in games. In terms of narrative quality, there can be some points of contention. Both melodramatic and insanely hard to follow at times due to the intricacy of the story that is being told, (especially to franchise rookies) the plot may turn off those that can\u2019t suspend disbelief. Characters will commit acts that shatter reason, even within the context of an already \u201cout there\u201d storyline. Still, I could not help but to be thoroughly engaged in the way it was presented.<\/p> <p>The melodrama and the plot belie the realism that Metal Gear Solid 4 can provide. From snow covered areas under white out conditions that considerably hampers your vision, to the emotion that characters show in their face, Metal Gear Solid 4 presents a believable world. The intensity that you feel in your gut while you\u2019re sneaking past enemy troops, or the shiver that goes up your spine when you\u2019re spotted is very real. The landscapes, the sound of two competing factions barking orders at their fellow troops, the guns firing\u2013all these components add to the gameplay in ways that are immeasurable.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s really what Metal Gear Solid 4\u2019s essence was about: the intensity of the fight. There are story elements that will please the hardcore MGS nuts and there are deeper, real-world themes explored here (though very beneath the surface, and it will vary from player to player what they get out of it) but the engaging cut-scenes are not what made Metal Gear Solid 4. It was fear. Fear of getting spotted. Fear of having to fight. Fear of failure. That intense, gut feeling powered the game throughout, and the story and well crafted cut-scenes round out an excellent game. Fan or not, Metal Gear Solid 4 deserves to be played.<\/p> <\/div>",

I then headed toward burger king on my quest to get this so called \"game\" I bought this thinking i just wasted my 4.99. I was wrong. The game is pretty addicting you move around 10 diffrent worls with 100 missions each and deliver food to people with stealh and ninja like skills. You start out in a construction site giving Biscuits away. There is no story line accept there are some hungy people that need food. So your charcter is \"the king\" himself. Gameplay is very fun using Splinter Cell like tactics (without the violence) to get past people to get to your target. the game looks horrible and the sounds is not much better either. but the game is 4.99 and fun so go to burger king and buy it.. If you can get past all the ban sounds and graphics you have a fun stealth based game. <\/p>",

      "deck": "Okami: A Swan Song Most Worthy of Clover's Name",
      "description": "<p>Created in a time when venerable developer Clover Studio was on its last legs, Okami is a game which naturally burdens itself with a number of expectations. Not only does it come after a line of well-loved Viewtiful Joe installments from the same developer, but an uncanny resemblance to other recent action-adventure games also raises the stakes for the quality which is to be expected from this game. Thankfully, though, Okami not only meets these standards, but often far exceeds them. The game may not be overly innovative, but thanks its method of following and executing genre trademarks extremely well, Okami turns out to be Clover Studio's most solid title to date. Additionally, its highly stylized visuals, beautiful soundtrack, and incredibly well-written localization show that it not only stands well against similar games, it's among the best in recent years. Make no mistake: Okami may superficially appear to be like many other games. But at its core is a very, very different beast.<br\/> <br\/> Okami is one of the few games to hit western shores which is utterly steeped in Japanese mythology. Few moments ever pass throughout the entire game that remind one that it is indeed of Asian origin. While this would normally be an impediment for the average gamer who isn't versed in such tales, Okami does a superb job at making sure everyone is on the same page throughout the entire story. Characters and plot sequences always receive their due explanation, allowing the unenlightened to catch up very easily. On top of that, the mythology is introduced only in bite-sized pieces. This enables players to become familiar with what they know over time so they can then move onto other facets of the mythology more easily and, by the end, feel utterly immersed in the world which Okami has created.<br\/> <br\/> The technique is introduced from the get-go. The beginning of the game starts off basic enough. 100 years prior to the game's beginning, Amaterasu, the Japanese sun god, as a wolf, defeated an eight-headed snake named Orochi (with some help) in order to free Kamiki Village from the task of annually sacrificing a maiden. Consequentially, though, Amaterasu died in the process and a memorial was set up in her place inside the village. However, when a bloke inadvertently lets Orochi loose again, Amaterasu is subsequently reincarnated to once again do the work she performed a century ago.<br\/> <br\/> There is, however, a major difference between the old wolf and the new one: The latter lacks special powers she had when fighting Orochi. These powers form the fundamental foundation for what helps to define Okami's gameplay. Instead of being typical godly powers a la superheroes and the like, these powers are activated through the use of a brush. When used correctly, this brush can perform a variety of things that no mortal could ever dream of doing, at least easily. Amaterasu, though, has lost virtually all of these powers and must search for them again in addition to her Orochi-related duties.<br\/> <br\/> The game is kind, though, and relents the first few powers early on. Things such as restoring broken or lost things and slashing are soon accessible in the beginning of the game. Over time, Amaterasu acquires other abilities to use in tandem with her brush, such as lightning strikes, wind gusts, and cherry bombs, among others. Each power is well-used and has its own applications both during times of exploration and combat, as they get used in very clever ways throughout each portion. Activating these powers is extremely easy, requiring only the tap of a button to bring up a canvas and then proceeding to draw the desired symbol. Using the brush takes up ink and only a limited amount of it can be used for each drawing. However, it does regenerate quickly enough and usually runs out only when the powers are used liberally in a given situation.<br\/> <br\/> The brush isn't the only tool at Amaterasu's disposal, though. Several different types of weapons, ranging from blades to chains to shields (yes, shields) are available. Each weapon in the game can either be equipped as the main weapon or as the sub-weapon, which has implications on the weapon's abilities in battle and vary greatly depending on how they're assigned. Because the amount of ink the game grants players is limited, even after upgrades, one will be relying heavily on these weapons during combat. The combat itself is what one would expect from a modern action-adventure game, consisting of running up to enemies, hitting them, blocking their reply, and repeating the process. Brush usage notwithstanding, the mechanics of Okami's combat will be very familiar to anyone who has played similar games. With the brush, though, an extra spice is added and, oftentimes, using the brush is a requirement when fighting against certain enemies, as they are weak to certain powers. These weaknesses can often be found just by using some logic after looking at their designs and it adds a very rare element of puzzles outside of the exploration aspect of such games. There are other nuances to the combat, such as item collection, but much of it optional and not experiencing them doesn't detract from playing the game. Fighting is usually a rather easy affair in the game, though. (It's very possible for one to not even die once throughout the entire game.) But, as a consolation to those who may want to avoid possible tediousness, one can get out of many battles, although this has consequences of its own.<br\/> <br\/> The exploration part of the game is also reminiscent of other action-adventure games. Okami provides a very large world to delve into and even the beginning areas where players are confined to are vast and rich with secrets. Over time, other areas are unlocked, each one being more unique than the last. Before the conclusion is reached, Okami shows locations as different as a quaint village and an underwater city, as well as many other imaginative places in-between. The game also has its share of dungeons. However, unlike games such as The Legend of Zelda, dungeon crawling is only a relatively occasional affair, showing up just often enough to show that it's there without being overdone. Even amidst such scant showings, though, the dungeons are just as excellently designed as all of the other areas in the game. Each one has its own very distinct theme which often defy the stereotypes commonly seen in other games. The puzzles, even with their low difficulty, are very creative and fit in well with its respective environment. Not one looks unnatural in its setting, allowing the dungeons to be distinct while still feeling a part of Okami's world.<br\/> <br\/> While the combat and exploration aspects of it may be derivative of games which have come before it, few games implement both so well. The mechanics driving each are so solid that the idea of fixing what isn't broken is something which actually works to Okami's advantage. It doesn't toy with the action-adventure formula of today, but instead uses it as a very steady foundation and it does an excellent job at doing so. This is one of the few games which doesn't need innovation to be truly enjoyable, since the familiarity is so finely executed that it raises the standard for which other games in the future should follow should they choose a similar path. Okami is that enjoyable; it makes one forget that it doesn't innovate the gameplay in its own genre.<br\/> <br\/> This is not to say that Okami doesn't pioneer areas in gaming other than gameplay. Visually, the game is one of the most artistically striking games this past generation. It embraces its Japanese background in every conceivable manner. This is most easily seen in the game's employment of cel-shading, which evokes a style commonly seen in old Japanese paintings. Each model and texture is outlined in a thick black, with colorful palettes to boot. Absolutely everything receives its due artistic treatment, allowing the reality to immerse anyone in its mythological setting with ease. Okami also happens to be one of the PS2's most beautiful games to date. In fact, it's almost even too hot to handle for the system. The graphics push the system almost near breaking point and, in one area, this is clearly seen in a very slight frame rate drop. But beyond that, the system handles the game like a charm, granting an easy ticket to a world of eye candy.<br\/> <br\/> The sounds and music of the game are also done with an equal caliber. The former does its best to make sure everything sounds the way it should, while imposing its own flair at the same time. Dialog, while text based, has each character vocalizing their lines in a unique jargon, much like Animal Crossing's animalese. But unlike Nintendo's game, Okami uses this speech to help make each character unique without ever saying an actual word. One can even pick up imitations of things such as French accents through this use of quasi-speech. As for the latter, Okami's music uses a full orchestra and utterly everything is done in this manner. Even tiny ditties garner such quality. The lengthier musical pieces are where the high quality really shines above all, though. Theme songs, background music, and the like all have excellent compositions on par with even the best in other entertainment industries. Many of the major pieces are also used sparingly, too, preventing the music from ever growing repetitive. But, like Okami's graphics, what its music really does best at is embracing its Japanese background. Japan-centric instruments are often key players in the game's music and are used to their full potential. It works just as hard as all of the other fundamental pieces of the game to establish this myth-centric world and it most certainly succeeds in that objective.<br\/> <br\/> Okami also has mastery over something much less emphasized in most games: localization. Few games that receive a translation today get one which goes above and beyond doing the straightforward. This is arguably what is most memorable about Okami. Every line of text, every speech, and every description has a level of polish which shows that time, effort, and love went into making the game accessible and appealing to non-Japanese audiences. Besides simply making the mythology understandable to the uninitiated, the localization defines one's experiences with Okami's denizens. Every single character, from the major to the very modest (including unnamed ones), receives their own word style and feel very developed. In particular, Issun, a character who tags along with Amaterasu on her quest for much of the game, is one who shows how beneficial a thorough localization can be for players. His speech overflows with his bubbling, vivacious personality that never fails to entertain throughout the 30-plus-hour-long journey. Touches like giving life to the characters is why Okami's localization is something which ought to be lauded as much as its more external characteristics such as graphics and sound. It's just that excellent.<br\/> <br\/> Okami is an wonderful swan song for Clover. It takes everything which an action-adventure game should be and executes it beautifully. Combine that with almost near-perfect quality in graphics, sounds, music, and localization and you have a game which needs to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Don't be bogged down by its mythological background or its lack of substantial innovation. For every minor issue which Okami has, it more than makes up for the flaw elsewhere in spades. This a game which truly does have something for everyone to enjoy. Simply put, Okami shows how far gaming can go not only artistically, but also in terms of fun. If you have a PS2 and even the slightest inkling to experience something very unfamiliar in seeming familiar territory, then Okami is most certainly going to be your cup of tea, and a superb one at that.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>After my scathing review of the demo, and various other reviews I did afterwards, I guess I don\u2019t have any hate left to spare for this game. I enjoy it tons, for some reason. And in case I have not enough reviewed this title\u2026<\/p> <p>Some things I have not yet covered (shocking, I know). I dig how you can replenish lost grenades and ammo by running over a dead foes supplies (ammo through specific class only); the limited splash damage (which emphasizes precision); distinct classes; and persistent and constant accomplishment (wildcards, patches, and trophies).<\/p> <p>I think Bad Company handles challenges and rewards the best out of itself, Call of Duty 4 and Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. I never get tired of the sound effect and dangling reward. Just for the uninitiated, the game rewards you trophies for accomplishing tasks (i.e., 3 kills with an anti-tank mine, 5 kills with transport vehicle, healing team mates, etc.). Patches unlock by fulfilling multiple trophies (Bronze Support Patch is dangled after fulfilling 2 kills as Support, 1 LMG efficiency trophy, 1 medic trophy, and 1 combat engineer trophy). If those weren\u2019t enough, BFBC also features Wildcards that unlock and dangle by fulfilling rare and exotic tasks (i.e., 100 headshots with any sniper rifle, destroy 3 vehicles of same kind and 2 of another, 50 Avenger trophies, etc.). By allowing these accomplishments to be acquired multiple times infinitely, it rewards play and extends gameplay. I think the Call of Duty series should adopt it.<\/p> <p>I also appreciate how knife kills must be earned and earn a reviewable database of dog tags. The points system is also preferable featuring special points for avenging team mates, destroying vehicles, healing team mates, and other various tasks. I read reviews that state this distracts from objectives and encourages the lack of teamwork. I disagree. This is where the weakened firepower benefits gameplay as kills must be earned. Since kills are not guaranteed, working to accomplish an objective, say arming a charge, is a good way to score points (30 guaranteed points for successfully destroying a crate).<\/p> <p>An improvement would be adding more default guns per class. Each team has a different gun design but those guns share the same values. Only unlockable guns (promotional and progressive) offer more variety amongst gun values. More progressive unlockable guns would also be appreciated; more multiplayer modes would be also be nice.<\/p> <p>While an initial grievance, the weakened firepower works with this title. If the guns were more powerful, it would unbalance gameplay. What does need to be tweaked is the range of a few guns. The shotguns need less range, for instance.<\/p> <p>Bad Company is a nice way to spend time waiting for World at War, SOCOM, and Gears 2. Now, if only they\u2019d soon release the damn update said to improve the party mode, offer clan support, and other fixes and updates.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Does running around blowing things up, riding helicopters, jumping from car to car and parachuting from jets in a 10000 km squared tropical island sound good to you? Well, then this is the game for you. It does lack a serious, long story and is flawed, but is still fun in many ways. <br\/>Let me start with the story. The setting is great; a tropical island ruled by a political tyrant. But once you actually get into the story it isn't so fun with a boring script, an unlikable main character and pretty underwhelming cinematics. So the story isn't great and it doesn't really spoil the game, but hopefully in the second game they will improve this small hindrance. So the campaign is satisfactory at best and it quite easy to get through, but instead of getting harder as you get through, it just gets longer. It also involves a lot of getting from point A to B and then to C and back to A. <br\/>Getting from the different missions can take a while, even by plane, but Avalanche have inserted a nice touch where you can either get your \"agency\" to drop you a vehicle wherever you are or get them to pick you up and drop you off at one of the numerous bases or campaign mission starting points. The side missions, involving helping the guerrillas and the drug baron, are different. While helping the guerrillas you liberate villages and towns by creating havoc, which is quite fun. But the rest of the normal missions (as well as the drug baron missions) get boring and unoriginal fast. Though I have been complaining a lot there are some fantastic ideas and other stuff which work really well. Being a one man army is great in some ways, because you can survive barrages of bullets and fall from great heights, you can jump out of a plane and hang on the tail or you can get in a super fast bike go off and cliff and pull out your parachute just before falling to a bloody mess. Being able to always fling yourself into the air makes you feel like a kind of superman, with guns. <br\/>The game looks fantastic especially when the sun rises or sets, and there is only about a 10 second loading screen at the beginning with no stopping for buffering as you fly through the huge island. If anything I would like to see the amazing engine sold to some other publishers. <br\/>I think Avalance have put a lot of effort into this but they just haven't put it together, this could have been a classic. All they really need is a better mission structure and perhaps a more detailed and smaller island with more going on. Maybe even a better story. Also, the gameplay is okay and not fitted really for keyboard and mouse and so if somebody has an xbox 360 as well as their PC, get the xbox 360 version instead. If you see this in a bargin bin, pick it up!<br\/><\/p>",

      "deck": "ICO: Simplistic in Design, Yet Profound in Implementation",
      "description": "<p>In a genre which has been as consistently crowded as the action-adventure for years, it can be incredibly difficult to make a game which not only stands out, but also has mechanics which work well and make the experience a rewarding one. Whereas most start with the category's basic foundation and then build upon and elaborate on that, ICO often does quite the opposite to great success. Eschewing complicated systems and instead preferring a vast amount of simplicity, the game tasks players with only the absolute bare necessities at all times and takes care of the rest itself. The resulting piece, while definitely on the short side, is a superb example of where successful implementation of a game's vision is most important for its overall effectiveness and quality. ICO certainly knows what it is doing in that respect and as such comes out as being something wonderful which needs to be experienced by any and all who truly understand the unique abilities of the video game medium.<br\/> <br\/> The premise of ICO and the primary motivation for moving onward are simplistically one and the same. Having both been trapped in a castle for their own respective reasons, the titular character and his companion, a girl by the name of Yorda, must find a way to escape and go out into the world. That alone may not necessarily sound thoroughly original, but the game's minimalistic style of storytelling allow it to still nevertheless feel unique. What it lacks in depth is made up for in spades in immersion, as the player is given the chance to weave their own sub-tale of sorts as they become more and more attached to Yorda.<br\/> <br\/> The literal version of that attachment is actually one of the two defining aspects of ICO's gameplay. As one traverses through the castle, they are often holding hands with the girl in an effort to stay together. This is especially a necessity during times of combat, in which the castle's shadowy minions obsess over retrieving Yorda and preventing her escape from coming to fruition. Moments when she is forcefully separated from the player are incredibly tense ones, as everyone's livelihoods ultimately rest on her survival. Even when there is not any actual fighting to be done, though, moments when there is not direct contact with Yorda are still anxiety-inducing, as being away from her has its own shares of implications, even when it is needed in order to proceed forward. A bond is formed between Ico\/the player and Yorda to such an extent that it is difficult not to care about her. This is despite the fact that it is impossible to verbally communicate with Yorda because she does not speak the same language as the protagonist, further emphasizing the need to be together as often as possible.<br\/> <br\/> The other defining facet of ICO's gameplay is its almost complete reliance on environmental puzzles. While certain mainstays such as the movable block are present, many others are more natural to the game's setting and as such require that creativity be used during the solving process. It all looks as though it is part of a castle, first and foremost, and while few puzzles require a lot of thought, none of it is overly blatant, either. From the purposes and abilities of each acquirable weapon to what can be used as climbing surfaces, the player must often derive the underlying context of why something is there in order to get past the current obstacle and proceed to the next one. Thankfully, the process is consistently smooth with little backtracking whatsoever, making ICO a fairly linear game despite initial appearances.<br\/> <br\/> What really helps set ICO vastly apart from virtually every other game in the action-adventure genre is its attention to detail in a number of oft-overlooked areas. Yorda is where a lot of this can be found and, if she's given enough mind, can be the source of minute awe-inspiring moments that are not directly related to the gameplay. If left to her own devices, for example, she may go off on her own and look at the scenery or watch some bird fluttering about in the current area. Or, if the player inadvertently hits a wall with their sword or stick, she might yelp in fright. She always manages to consistently show depth in areas where other tag-alongs in video games have been historically lacking. It is these and other such nuances in the game that ensure that the game's minor things stand out just as well as its major ones. They add plenty of spice to a flavor which is already highly exotic.<br\/> <br\/> Graphically, ICO emphasizes its environments and animations over everything else. The former, while having clearly aged since the game's 2001 release, still hold up very well stylistically. They do not necessarily push the PlayStation 2 to its breaking point, but they are still well-crafted and deserve plenty of applause for ensuring that nothing ever looks monotonous despite the singular nature of the setting. ICO's animations are a very nice extension of its devotion to detail, as they often capture even more little things which could easily be missed without a close inspection. From the hesitant delicacy which Yorda clearly has before clearing major jumps to the manner in which clothing is toyed around by the wind, the animations in the game are very well crafted. Other parts of the game's visuals such as character models do not have quite such lofty standards, but nevertheless manage to be stylish in order to make up for that fact. The frame rate also stays steady for the majority of the gameplay, with only slight falters in very few instances.<br\/> <br\/> ICO's sound design can only be accurately described as very deliberate. The majority of the playing time is spent without music, leaving the ambiance up to the environments. When it actually is present, it is always very low-key, being well-composed without overstepping its bounds and breaking into something overly (and unnecessarily) symphonic. Despite its seemingly obvious absence, the music is not something which is missed over the course of the gameplay, as those previously-mentioned ambient sounds succeed at immersing the player in the game's world. The game also employs a small amount of voice acting. Fictional languages are used for the verbal portion and they too do not go above and beyond their limits, which works perfectly fine. Corresponding subtitles are issued, although it should be noted that Yorda's are not in any earthly language whatsoever.<br\/> <br\/> The scope of ICO's achievements are profound. Few games before it have been able to abide by a minimalistic design mentality and actually have that work to their benefit. But because it always knows exactly what it wants to do in every conceivable area, ICO's vision shines through very vividly and because of that fact, its merits allow it to stand tall as one of the few games whose essence truly will endure historical wear and tear. It is not only a testament to the legacy which the PlayStation 2 is bound to leave behind, but also a testament to the unique characteristics which only video games can wield. Consider it a must-play for anybody interested in how flexible the medium can be and how that affects its profoundness in myriad ways.<\/p>",

You start out as a \"special forces\" soldier tasked with \"special high risk jobs\" It starts out buggy right at the beginning. You are in your room on your ship and they call your name over the loudspeak to come to the commander for a \"special mission\" to turn the power back on by pressing the f key. After that you are deployed to the ground. Then the game crashes. 3 patches AND IT STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!!! You can bring the game back up after that. One very cool thing about this game is over 1000 bugs coming at you at once. Very good graphics and guns and bugs are detailed. Take a look at your friends. There faces are small blocks with a 2 dots and a line for a mouth. WTF is wrong with the designers at Stranglite where they high when they made this game.Sounds sucks. The guns sound like water pistols the people have the same voice and the bugs make one sound. The game is a cheap 20 bucks and comes with a cool poster and art book.<br\/><br\/>The good. 100s of bugs at once,lots of gore<br\/><br\/>The bad: everything else accept what i said above. <\/p>",

      "deck": "Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved",
      "description": "<p>There are not many who lament the loss of the arcade space-shooter. With the great advances in visual technology over the years, it seems a strange choice for a developer to step back a couple of decades and hearken back to a simpler time. But that is exactly the premise behind Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, as the popular Xbox Live Arcade game makes the transition to the PC.<\/p><p>As expected Geometry Wars' graphics are nothing to write home about. The style is reminiscent of retro games, but it has been given a modern makeover. Featuring a simple 2D perspective it places the focus much more on game play, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In recent times, the emphasis for developers has been on creating the most visually realistic experience possible, the basic vector graphics featured in Geometry Wars therefore may put off many a modern gamer. Despite this, it does still look incredibly aesthetically pleasing; the bright neon colours contrast well with the space-theme backdrop, and the explosions look impressive.<\/p><p>Simple but addictive game play is what's on offer here and it pays off in abundance. Many hours can be whittled away playing Geometry Wars; it really does have a lot to offer. This has a great deal to do with the variety of different enemies you come up against, each of them behaving in a different way. The learning curve is particularly harsh, with enemies spawning at a faster and faster rate in a short amount of time, but this only serves to get you more hooked once you have mastered the basics. You will battle against an abundance of adversaries, from the electric-blue diamond shapes that hone in on you, to bright-red black holes that suck in anything around them until they explode, unleashing a wave of debris that swarms over the screen.<\/p><p>The music does get repetitive after a couple of hours of play, but more often than not it is drowned out by the torrent of laser fire. It does serve the purpose, however, of effectively accentuating the futuristic setting, it blends in well. The soundtrack also helps to build up the tempo of the game making for a more engaging experience. The audio feature serves as an integral role in the game as each enemy emits a different sound effect when it spawns. Because of this, it means that Geometry Wars engages you on multiple levels; it is difficult not to become immersed in the experience, a worthy accolade for any game.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the PC version lacks a great deal of features that made the Xbox 360 version so appealing. It doesn't have any form of achievement points, which means the game loses out somewhat in terms of the longevity factor. Moreover, the lack of online leader boards achieves the same effect. You lose the competitive aspect that was so prominent on the original, and as a result, the replay value of the game is affected. It is also rather cumbersome playing with a keyboard and mouse, the Xbox 360 version offered more freedom in this respect, the game is much more suited to playing with a controller.<\/p><p>Whilst it is clear that this adaptation of the game is inferior to that of the Xbox 360, it has enough redeeming qualities to make it a worthwhile purchase for those new to the concept. With its blend of fun, exciting game play and simple graphics, Geometry Wars is a great tool for procrastination by anyone's standards.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Staring at the clock, you consider starting another match. \u201cHey, I\u2019ll just set things up for when I play tomorrow!\u201d you say. Three hours later, you\u2019ve finished another Civilization Revolution match, and you\u2019re left wondering where the time went. Sounds like a Civilization game, doesn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re a veteran of the series, that\u2019s music to your ears.<\/p> <p>That\u2019s always the concern with PC strategy games making the jump to consoles \u2014 does it feel like the PC game? Too many times gamers have been double-crossed by game companies selling them soy milk, claiming it to be \u201cjust like the real thing!\u201d, only to have gamers take a swig of the soy milk, spit it out, get pissed off and run to message boards to bitch about the bad taste left in their mouth. (All apologies to soy milk fans) That is to say that Civilization Revolution wasn\u2019t stripped down to be \u201clike\u201d the real thing \u2014 it is.<\/p> <p>Saying Civilization Revolution is a Civilization game comes with all the positives and negatives associated with the franchise. Civilization Revolution, like previous Civilization games, can be ridiculously addicting, causing you to lose yourself for hours and hours planning out how best to dominate the world. Because it\u2019s a turn-based strategy game, it has the feel, much like an MMO, of \u201cI can do this task really quick and then I\u2019ll be done.\u201d But after you complete that task, two more tasks come to your attention and it starts to snowball from there. The addictive qualities are thanks in large part to the in-depth strategy that the Civilization franchise is known for. There are four different ways for you to win: military, financial, cultural and technological dominance. Each of the four victory paths have different objectives for you to aim for (military dominance, for example, has you taking over all of the other civilization\u2018s capitals), so tailoring what you build and research is key to reaching victory.<\/p><p>Keeping up with what units to build, technology to research, cities to attack, etc., can sometimes make newcomers to Civilization feel like a freshly hired waiter at a busy restaurant. You\u2019re juggling two different trays, not trying to drop the customer\u2019s food, while still trying to get there quickly in the hopes they give you a nice tip after they\u2019re done feasting. Eventually, a customer with a full bladder gets up to go to the bathroom, bumps into you and makes you drop everything, killing all your work. Civilization Revolution can be the same in that way \u2014 you do a lot of work to set your army up, you plan out your attack on a neighboring city, and then the other civilization\u2019s defenses are vastly superior to your expectations, crushing your planned \u201ctip\u201d for all that work. For newcomers like myself, learning what units to build and what technologies to research can be overwhelming at first, but when you finally get the hang of things and capture a city that you had been longing for, it makes the journey completely worth it \u2014 even if it was a bit messy getting there.<\/p> <p>In addition to the standard offline single-player, there are scenario missions and a \u201cgame of the week\u201d \u2014 a randomly generated new scenario for players. The game of the week is the same for everyone, and each week you can compete with others to get the highest ranking on online leaderboards. Online multiplayer is also included for up to three other players, It runs smoothly and without any lag issues, but might not be ideal if you don\u2019t have a couple hours to dedicate to the match.<\/p> <p>Audio-visually, Civilization Revolution is neither here nor there. The music isn\u2019t memorable, and the characters speak in this Sims-like gibberish that gets a little grating. Visually, you\u2019re getting a decent looking game considering the scope, but it\u2019s not going to \u201cwow\u201d you. Surprisingly, though, I did experience some significant slow-down in the game on a couple occasions, leading me to believe my console had frozen \u2014 instead, the game had screeched to a complete halt for about 10 seconds. Although the slowdown was puzzling, it only happened twice and never got in the way of the game.<\/p> <p>The highest praise you could give a game like Civilization Revolution is to say that it plays like its PC counterparts. It might not be for everyone, but for the hardcore strategy fan, you finally have a console strategy game that isn\u2019t broken and busted. Instead, you\u2019re getting the same addicting, deep gameplay you\u2019ve seen on the PC. Drink up \u2014 you\u2019re not getting soy milk for once \u2014 you\u2019re getting the real thing.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Unreal Tournament III was originally released in the fall of last year for the PC and PS3. Now, UT3 graces the Xbox 360 with its fast and furious gameplay, but is it worth shelling out $60 dollars for? UT3 for Xbox 360 comes with all the downloadable content available for the PS3 and PC versions of the game along with 2 new characters, 5 exclusive maps, split-screen multiplayer and Online Co-Op via Xbox Live.<br\/> <br\/> UT3 offers multiple modes and options to choose from when you first boot up the game. You can go through UT3\u2019s rather mediocre single player mode, own or be owned in the Instant Action mode where you make the rules and take on some bots or take the fight online in the fantastic multiplayer mode. The single player mode is mediocre at best and has a laughable story that is really there just to give you an incentive to keep pushing forward. The single player is split up into five main chapters and a tutorial. To be honest though, the entire single player experience feels more like tutorial then an actual campaign. Each chapter starts out with a cutscene and you choosing one of multiple \u201cmissions\u201d which are really just multiplayer matches against bots. The single player is rather easy on the standard difficulty settings, but if you are up to the challenge you can try to complete the game on the harder difficulties. The enemy AI isn\u2019t bad, but it isn\u2019t great either. Enemies will take cover, but always seem to know exactly where you are. Your partner AI seems to be rather dumb at times. In Capture the Flag for example: your partners will rarely get the flag and even when they do you\u2019ll often see them trying to kill the other team instead of making a run for your own base. Even when they aren\u2019t they will rarely score a point. The single player altogether felt like it was put there just for the sake of having a single player mode, it\u2019s nice, but was it really needed? <br\/> <br\/> Unreal Tournament is a series known for its excellent multiplayer and fast and furious gameplay. UT3 on the 360 is no different. The Xbox 360 version of UT3 includes a split-screen multiplayer mode that is a fantastic addition to the game that works flawlessly and is great when you have a couple of friends over and just want to maim and destroy each other with Rocket Launchers in Morbias Arena. Getting into an online match is simple. Select the multiplayer option in the menu and either choose the \u201cQuick Match\u201d option or \u201cfind server\u201d. You can change your search settings to match what you are looking for. You can also host your own matches with your own rules and settings. Once online, depending on the match type, you basically just frag the other team as much as many times as you can till you win. Boasting a ton of maps and multiple game modes ranging from your traditional deathmatch to the new Warfare mode, multiplayer is what really makes UT3 shine.<br\/> <br\/> Unreal Tournament III, like its predecessors, has some very fun and excellent gameplay. Not a whole lot has changed since the last game, it\u2019s still the same fast frag fest that you come to know and love. Classic Unreal Tournament weapons make a return in UT3, from the Bio Rifle to the Rocket Launcher. UT3 also has multiple vehicles that you can utilize on the battlefield. Turning in vehicles is very similar to that of Halo 3; you move your aiming reticule in the direction that you want to go and use the left stick to move in the desired direction. This can be a bit of a pain at times, but after some time you will get used to it. Unlike many FPS\u2019s on the market you do not need to reload, you can carry more than 2 weapons and there are no grenades. Pick up a gun, some ammo and unload. As you pick up ammo it is automatically added to your gun so that it doesn\u2019t slow down the overall pace of the game. Controls are you what you would expect. Shooting is mapped to the right trigger with the alternate fire on the left trigger, jumping to A, and switching weapons is done by either pressing the right bumper to move to the next weapon in your inventory or by holding the left bumper which brings up a weapon wheel which you then select the weapon you want to use via the left stick. UT3\u2019s gameplay is fun for many reasons. One: it\u2019s fast, two: it\u2019s got many weapons and maps, and most important of all it\u2019s fun as hell.<br\/> <br\/> Unreal Tournament III runs on Epic\u2019s excellent Unreal 3 engine. This engine powers many games that boast amazing visuals such as Epic\u2019s own Gears of War and Unreal franchises, but also the masterpiece that is BioShock. UT3 looks absolutely gorgeous...most of the time. There are times where slowdown rears its ugly head, but this doesn\u2019t really affect the gameplay as it only appears for a very brief moment or two. A lot of the texture work isn\u2019t as great as it could be, but it\u2019s hardly noticeable unless you decide to stop and look at something for a moment which will then be followed up by you getting blown up by a Flak Cannon, not recommended. There isn\u2019t a whole lot to say on the audio side of things. The voice work is good, but cheesy and the music that plays during matches is a bit repetitive, but hardly noticeable as you\u2019ll most likely only be focusing on not getting your head blown off by some guy (or girl) running around with a sniper rifle. One thing that the Xbox 360 version of UT3 doesn\u2019t have that the PS3 and PC versions do is user created mods. This is something that the UT series is also known for and it is extremely disheartening that it didn\u2019t make it into the game.<br\/> <br\/> <b>Bottom Line:<\/b> Unreal Tournament III is a great first-person shooter with a fairly mediocre single player mode, but truly shines when you dive into the robust multiplayer mode that the series is known for. The lack of user mods is really disappointing (we can blame Microsoft for that one), but despite that, Unreal Tournament III is a great game boasting top notch visuals and gameplay and is something any FPS fan should look into getting.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Gameplay<br\/> Basically the games consists of two type of gameplay strategy where you play as an angel shooting arrows to kill demons, performing tasks for the villagers and hack and slash where you as God himself kick demon butt using your sword and magic.<br\/> The strategy works by first you choose a location to start on there will be a few demons and a temple you kill the demons which gives you more people you then direct the growth of the people towards the demons so they can seal them then the people will eventually uncover some sort of evil and you as God have to go down and finish the job!<br\/> The hack and slash is pretty much self explanatory there is some light platforming in the levels and enemies are thrown at you but you never feel overwhelmed by them as your guy seems just powerful enough to take anyone down.<br\/> <br\/> Graphics<br\/> Graphically the game is quite stunning for the SNES the enemies all have different designs and the levels range from a desert to snowy mountains. Judging graphics for older games is hard as you have to try and put yourself back into the time it was released. Basically it\u2019s like a quite high end GBA game.<br\/> <br\/> Sound <br\/> The Audio in this game is great from the noises the demons make down to the music. The music is just what you expect from a enix game it\u2019s really quite epic and they have memorable tunes you'll be humming to for some time.<br\/> <br\/> Value<br\/> Well if you\u2019re a collector you\u2019re definitely going to want and track this game down it\u2019s a classic and something of a rarity. Plus there is some replay value to it experimenting with the development of people but only slightly as that aspect of the game isn\u2019t very deep.<br\/> <br\/> Overall anyone who is a fan of hack and slash games will definitely want to check this out as it mixes in strategy elements quite well, plus collectors are going to want to add this game to fill the void in their collection.<br\/> This is one game to look out for on the Wii!<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">If you are looking at this review, chances are you\u2019re on the fence on the whole GTA money machine, for if you are a fan you would already possess this game and your bloodshot eyes would tell the tale of late nights and long days.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Well Grand Theft Auto IV may not sway those apposed to the whole general concept of the game altogether, it does offer the complete GTA experience, and then some, for those who are indeed undecided.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>For those returning for the 7 time, or those looking to see what the series has to offer them, the fine folks at Rockstar manage to throw everything they could think of into this melting pot of a game so there is bound to be something that will satisfy you.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>GTA:IV maintains the common theme of \u201cmore,\u201d for there is more to do, more to see, more time to kill, more of everything that makes up a Grand Theft Auto game.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>So does it live up to the hype bestowed upon it?<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">A very important key component to this well based series is the exceptional story telling that it consists of.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>In keeping with what the audience expects, GTA:IV see the rise and fall of center stage protagonist Niko Bellic, an immigrant fleeing some untold events from the motherland for a more \u201cprosperous\u201d life in the land of opportunity.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>He meets up with his already native cousin and is immediately and unwillingly thrown into chaos as he struggles to protect those he cares about all the while seemingly getting further and further from his objective.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Like all good GTA games, this one is packed with twists and split paths.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The events even fork at a certain point depending on choices you make while playing.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The story has been this title\u2019s lightning rod to fame, attracting all kinds of praise and top scores from all the top reviewing outlets.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>There is truth to this, for this story is by far the most engrossing, emotional and down right awesome tales you will ever see associated with a video game.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sure the <i>type <\/i>of story might not appeal to everyone.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>That being said, this is a masterpiece of gaming screenplay that has ever graced a console.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>For all those screaming, \u201cOverrated!\u201d<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>We all know you have not played through it.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">For all the improvements on the way the story is told, Rockstar has tweaked about every other facet of this game, starting with the most influential.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Those returning to the series will find that the vehicle handling has been noticeable changed.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Not just in the control placement (the shoulder buttons are now your acceleration and brake\/reverse) but in the handling overall.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>You will no longer be able to pull the hand brake and swing around turns like you used to, or if you are skilled enough to master the technique in this iteration, you won\u2019t be able to do so easily.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>That being said it is hard to determine if they are trying to make the handling more realistic or just more technical, either way, it won\u2019t hold you back for long.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">You are going to need those new car controls as you discover that the staple to the GTA, the wanted level, has also been changed.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The days of struggling to find a Pay \u2018n Spray as your car is being pummeled by police and government cruisers is over. They have traded this with an upgraded radial system.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Now when you are being perused, you will see a flashing blue\/red circle around you.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The diameter of this circle changes with respect to your wanted level.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The more stars, the bigger the circle.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>You will also gain the advantage of being able to see nearby police vehicles right on your radar in a Driver-esqu type feel.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The name of the game now is avoidance.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you are able to get outside of the wanted awareness parameter, and stay outside of it by not attracting attention, you will lose your pursuers and be just an average citizen again.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Take this new system as you will, it does make it easier to lose your wanted level.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">The only other main difference is obviously the attention to detail that, in terms of sheer magnitude, has surpassed all attempts thus far.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The game is so detailed that you will find moments where you are just dumbstruck.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Not only is it a nice game to look at, the new generation of hardware is to thank for that, but the way the people behave and act, the level of detail in the everyday events, that is where it gets awe inspiring.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Liberty City is beautiful, the people are purpose driven even the street preacher will come close to selling you his religion.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The way the characters act will really drive home the feeling of realism that the entire game produces.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">Along with all this you get a quick batch of mini games, from the standard bowling, (a fair game) pool, (horrible mini game) and darts, (by far the easiest) to the nifty little arcade cabinets, there is always more to do.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Complimenting these are the theaters, where you can see a mix mash of magicians, performers, or just crazy people, to the comedy club where some of the bits are truly funny.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>All of these, along with eating, going out for a drink, or going to a \u201cgentlemen\u2019s club\u201d are all things that you can waste your time doing at any point during the game.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>They become especially critical in the relationship mechanic that Rockstar has tweaked.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Through the course of the game, you will develop friends that you in term have to spend time with by doing any one of said events to gain special abilities, such as a taxi service, or weapons being delivered to you.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">This along with some cheap SIXAXIS controls and an upgraded cover and gun fight mechanic round out the most noticeable changes in the game.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The SIXAXIS control is awful, you won\u2019t ever find a need to use it.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The new gun fighting on the other hand, is truly impressive and is leaps and bounds over what you saw in San Andreas.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>It is hard to describe other then saying it works.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>They even go as far as to throw in destructible cover, so hiding behind some boxes, not going to cut it I\u2019m afraid.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This new mechanic goes hand in hand with the games hardened difficulty.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Not to go as far as being punishing, it will frustrate the hell out of you<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Then again, that is always part of Grand Theft Auto, there will always be missions where you will have to go through them again and again until you finally figure,<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cI\u2019ll just use the rocket launcher and blow up the stupid car instead of chasing him around town for an hour!\u201d<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Luckily the game has an auto save feature, a long awaited addition that makes having to run to a safe house for a quick save between missions a thing of the past.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count: 1\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">With all of these factors going for the title, it\u2019s not hard to see why GTA has such a profound following in the gaming community.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This \u201cfourth\u201d installment in the series sees that same tried and true tested formula expanded exponentially to fit more detail and depth then ever before, all being crammed onto a disc with only a minimal install time to work with.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This game truly does show the raw power of the current generation of consoles compared to its predecessors.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>You will feel for Niko and the hard choices he makes.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>You will love the improvements to all aspects of the game, especially that auto save!<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>As for the overall mark that is going to brand this game for all of its accomplishments, this reviewer puts it as high as it could expect to go.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The only fault this game possesses is that it is

      "description": "<p>Believe it or not, stealth action games haven\u2019t always been around. Not until 1998 would the gaming world be set ablaze, with the now infamous Metal Gear Solid. The series itself spans the course of decades, and has since received both the praise and ridicule of many, due to its dialogue-heavy storyline. And just five years after its initial release, someone at Konami apparently thought it was a good time to release a remake of the classic tale\u2014and thus Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes was born.<br\/><br\/>The story of Metal Gear Solid is about as saturated and provocative as they get, so large that it couldn\u2019t all fit within one game. Although the game starts out simple enough, don\u2019t let it fool you; the plot quickly becomes a tangled web. The game puts players in the shoes of a government agent of sorts, attempting to thwart a nuclear catastrophe. As Solid Snake, you are forced out of early retirement and back into the field. A group of next-generation Special Forces has taken over a nuclear disposal facility on the Alaskan isle, Shadow Moses. They\u2019ve taken some important hostages and are making demands, posing a nuclear threat to the United States if they don\u2019t cooperate. To further complicate matters, they\u2019re being led by the elite unit FOXHOUND, a group of complete nut-cases. This structure is really just a forefront to something greater, as throughout the course of the game Snake will grow as a human, learn to asses his surroundings, and shape his own destiny\u2014as well as his enemies.<br\/><br\/>The core of the gameplay pits you in a third-person perspective, where you take action against enemy soldiers patrolling the facility. It\u2019s like putting a kid in a candy store, where everything is for the taking, which in this case is the life of your opposition. There are a variety of ways you can take out your foes, whether it be conventional or extraordinary. A quick bullet to the head can solve many a situation, but you may find yourself aching for more creative methods, such as knocking enemies unconscious or snapping their neck. But above all else, it depends on the situation.<br\/><br\/>Making noise or being spotted is not a choice idea, as an alarm will be sounded and reinforcements will be called. The enemies are good at overwhelming you, so your best recourse is to stay out of sight. You have a better chance of surviving if you take the necessary precautions and\u2014above all else\u2014have patience. Until you get a suppressor for your main handgun, you\u2019ll probably want to resort to the pistol loaded with tranquilizers. This puts enemies to sleep and allows you to pass unnoticed. Placing your back against a wall is a keen idea, as you can then peek around corners while remaining concealed, and fit into tight spots otherwise unreachable. Hanging off of ledges can also apply to a certain situation; just remember that you have a grip meter to keep an eye on. If an unfortunate turn of events happens to alert the guards, do yourself a favor and hide in a locker, or perhaps under a tabletop. If you\u2019re interested in giving them a run for their money, try shooting pipes or other objects to slow their travel, or perhaps set a trap for them. These tense moments can really get the adrenaline flowing, but it\u2019s important to remember the stealth aspect of the game, as Snake is better suited to the shadows.<br\/><br\/>With all this emphasis on hiding and running away, you\u2019d think that there wouldn\u2019t be a lot of attention put on weapons\u2026but you\u2019d be wrong. The gear you amass throughout the game serves up a sizable inventory, letting you to tackle just about any situation. To aid your itchy trigger-finger are the likes of pistols, rifles, grenades and missile launchers\u2014and several variants for that matter. Pistols are equipped with a laser sight, and are best for focusing on intricacies, which is made considerably easier with the inclusion of a first-person aiming mechanic. Rifles come in the assault and sniper variety, where one is for full-frontal battles, and the other is for picking off enemies from a large distance. Grenades come in many flavors (none of which are cherry), and can prove to be invaluable assets. Beyond the realm of weapons, you can also find performance-enhancing drugs, and the all too recognizable cardboard box. Heck, even the cigarettes Snake carries have uses other than blackening your lungs, as the smoke itself can be used to detect infrared beams; this man is clearly the MacGyver of the future!<br\/><br\/>Solid Snake has more than just tricks up his sleeves, however. While he may appear to be your generic super-soldier (with his advanced sneaking suit and all), looks are incredibly deceiving. Though he\u2019s definitely a killing machine, the thing he does more than anything is ask questions. Poor Snake was sent into his mission essentially blindfolded, and it seems that no turn of events ever unfolds as expected. As you progress with the game and learn of new plot twists, chances are Snake is learning with you\u2014making the relationship between character and player that much more seamless. His voice itself is synonymous with the character, and\u2014while gravely and over-acted\u2014provides yet another layer of depth to the man of the hour. His past is something to marvel at, and by the end of the game chances are that your outlook on him will have changed significantly. The supporting characters themselves only add to the experience, as they all have their own dark history to deal with.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps the most compelling acquaintances are the ones you meet on the battlefield. The members of FOXHOUND are quite the lovable cast, and provide some of the most memorable encounters in all of video gaming. What\u2019s more is that they all seem to be linked to Snake in one way or another, not unlike an episode of Lost. They all have a specific gimmick to call their own, and more importantly, very distinct voices\u2014which make them all the more recognizable. Sniper Wolf is an immaculate sniper with an obsession for whoever her target may be, Psycho Mantis has a knack for telekinesis and reading peoples minds, and Revolver Ocelot wields\u2026well, a revolver; he also has a thing for torture. But perhaps the most important antagonist of all is the leader of this organization, Liquid Snake. He bears a striking resemblance to our hero, but has long blonde hair and a decidedly English accent. Throw all that in with a cyborg ninja and a giant robot and you\u2019ve got yourself a game.<br\/><br\/>Much like the stars of the show, the game itself screams individuality. It\u2019s comforting at times to know that a story with as much weight as Metal Gear Solid\u2019s can find the time to take a break. It\u2019s very self-referential, and at times can become laugh-out-loud funny. Pull out your pack of cigarettes, and prepare to be lectured on the dangers smoking can cause to your health. Does Colonel Campbell seem familiar? Look no further than Rambo. Easter eggs are also in major abundance, and are just waiting to be uncovered. The re-playability is immense, as the game contains a glut of bonus material\u2014you just have to look between the lines to discover it. Just messing around with the enemy sentries can be very amusing; a cardboard box and a bottle of ketchup is all you need for a good time.<br\/><br\/>Times are good indeed, as in case you\u2019ve forgotten\u2014this game has been remade. For one, all of the voice-work in the game has been completely re-recorded, so everything feels fresh for veterans. In light of the additions Metal Gear Solid 2 brought to the formula, some gameplay tweaks have been made. The biggest of these enhancements would be the first-person perspective, which makes it much easier to aim your weapon at whatever you choose\u2014be it a head or the occasional surveillance camera. All you softies will be happy to hear of the inclusion of non-lethal weapons, such as the M9 pistol and PSG1-T. And for maneuverability\u2019s sake, moves such as climbing over obstacles and the diving somersault have been added. Yet the biggest improvement comes from the cut-scenes themselves, as they have been completely revamped. Now featuring stylish acrobatics, you better start getting used to Snake doing some incredibly huge back flips.<br\/><br\/>No matter how cool Snake looks, he still can\u2019t conceal all the missteps this restoration has taken. While the first-person view certainly provides some fun, it essentially breaks the game. This along with the M9 make the game extremely easy, as if it wasn\u2019t enough already. This wouldn\u2019t inherently be a problem, if the game wasn\u2019t a direct port of its predecessor. Both enemy and weapon placement seem to be identical to the original, and the game design does little but shoehorn these new elements into something that\u2019s not really built for it. Although most of the voice acting is substantial, it can be slightly disappointing at times. The performances on whole don\u2019t seem as eccentric as they used to be, and this was one of the initial charms about the game. The dialogue is practically the same, line for line. Which begs the question: why were the voices redone at all? The voice actors themselves have aged, so it doesn\u2019t make any contextual sense. On top of that, when battles get heated you\u2019re greeted with a massive frame-rate drop\u2014who knew slowdown could be this fun? The tip of the iceberg: The Gamecube controller is missing four buttons; basic functionality is hindered because of this. Pressing Start + A to open up the codec screen is about as intuitive as performing open heart surgery with your elbows.<br\/><br\/>But hey, don\u2019t blame it all on the Game Cube. One of the fundamental problems with Metal Gear Solid is just how dated it is. It\u2019s amazing what used to be acceptable design philosophy a decade ago. The controls themselves are needlessly complicated, unless you find holding three buttons simultaneously while aiming and shooting intuitive. Battles with the crouching mechanic await you\u2014as going prone by accident, crawling backwards, and spinning around in place is a common occurrence\u2014especially during intense moments. To compliment Snake\u2019s abstract snow-angels, are a wonderful lineup of stick figure-like animations. Climbing, running, crouching, and shooting\u2014it all looks awful. How about those next-generation forces? If by next-generation you mean poky enemies with no peripheral vision. With the ability to see three feet in front of themselves, these genetically enhanced soldiers may need to get their prescription adjusted.<br\/><br\/>In the end, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is essentially the same game with a fresh coat of paint. Of course, that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as this opens up the intriguing world of Snake to an entirely new generation. What lies beyond the candy-coating is a powerfully gripping narrative, one that impeccably blends fact and fiction, crafting a unique method of storytelling. Once positioned as a phenomenally realistic experience, it\u2019s definitely less \u201creal\u201d by today\u2019s standards\u2014yet remains unparalleled. While it certainly isn\u2019t for everyone, you at least owe it to yourself to give it a whirl, as you might walk out an enlightened individual.<br\/><br\/>- Michael Rivard<\/p>",

      "deck": "Half Life 2",
      "description": "<p>As a huge fan of the original Half Life, I was incredibly apprehensive approaching its sequel. Sure, I'd heard great things, but you hear positive consensus about a great deal of games that when you actually play, turn out to disappoint you. I was incredibly relieved to discover in my first few minutes of play, that Half Life 2 is one of those few sequels that manages to live up to the standard set by its predecessor.<\/p><p>Half Life 2 again follows the escapades of scientist and unlikely hero; Gordon Freeman. Following his adventures at Black Mesa, a long time has passed. You are again called upon to save humanity and are plunged back into the fray by the mysterious G-man (a recurring character from the first game) to save Earth from the clutches of the evil Combine, a mysterious force that has managed to conquer the planet and enslave its population. Clearly the storyline gives the gamer a familiar scenario to overcome, but there is so much more to Half Life 2 than just that.<\/p><p>What first hits you when you pick up and play Half Life 2 is the graphical difference between it and the original. Even now, a couple of years after its release, this game still has the power to blow you away with its breathtaking visuals. It is obvious that Half Life 2 is a work of passion, of love for gaming, as it really does go all out to deliver the best gaming experience possible. The diversity of levels is astounding, and the graphics perfectly complement this, capturing an essence of realism not unearthed to the same extent in the previous chapter, but all the while maintaining that traditional Half Life feel. From the bustling City 17, to the zombie-infested Ravenholm, to wide expanses of wasteland, the level design in this game is phenomenal, and it adds a great deal to the enjoyment that you experience. Such stellar level design makes great strides towards creating a sense of atmosphere that was so prominent in the original. A common feature of many FPS games is that they all have a similar art style throughout, and as such, many of the levels appear very similar, and get rather repetitive and mundane after a couple of hours of play. Whilst Half Life 2 does have continuity in terms of art style, each level is so vastly different to the one that preceded it; it feels like every chapter is its own game, adding greatly to the excitement factor, and keeping the gamer hooked from start to finish.<\/p><p>In terms of gameplay, again, Half Life 2 pulls out all the stops. You of course have recurring elements of gameplay that have been carried through; bashing through openings with the crowbar, crawling through air vents, carefully manoeuvring around ledges. In many ways it is pleasing to see that they didn't deviate too much from the original game. Usually with a sequel, in an attempt to make the game look new and exciting, developers ruin the very essence of what made the games good in the first place. I was pleased to see that Valve has managed to balance the old elements with the new elements exceptionally well, as it doesn't feel like a clone of the original Half Life, but it feels like it belongs to the same family. Which is how, in a perfect world, all sequels should be. The game has a great deal of variety in terms of gameplay also, from basic shoot-em-up elements, to introducing puzzles and vehicle sequences, all of which captivate the interest of the gamer, and make sure that the experience is as exciting in the last minute as it is in the first. Simply put, Half Life 2 is a great deal of fun to play, and I was pleased to see that just as much emphasis was put upon delivering an enjoyable gaming experience, as was placed upon the need for nice, shiny graphics. Again, in this aspect, Half Life 2 appears to have got the balance just right.<\/p><p>The great wealth of enemies available to fight was a great surprise to me. I expected what is the norm for most games; a few core enemies interspersed with extra characters every couple of levels. Half Life 2 goes above and beyond the call of duty, introducing a huge army of evil creatures, from the headcrabs and barnacles featured in the previous game, to new additions, such as the ferocious ant lions. The Combine soldiers also add a sense of familiarity, as you are fighting against soldiers, a common enemy of the genre, but one that is as adept and proficient in the use of weaponry as you are, which makes for some tense combat situations. This is aided by the fact that the AI in the game is top notch, as at some key moments you are really put up against it, and have to use a variety of tactics to come out on top.<\/p><p>The story, I hasten to add, was somewhat of a disappointment. I touched on this notion previously, that while it carries on elements featured in the original, and features recurring characters; Half Life 2 makes little effort to fill us in on what has happened to Freeman since the debacle of the previous game. As an avid fan of the original, this annoyed me, as I expected the game to fill me in on certain questions that were raised previously. This does create a sense of mystery that works relatively well as an accompaniment to the storyline, but in reality it would have been better to see some elements of the story drawn to a conclusion, as you get the sense that Half Life 2 was merely paving the way for future sequels. The story that it does contain is hardly groundbreaking, the Combine are effectively futuristic terrorists, and in this sense Half Life 2 does little to move away from what is the basis of so many clich\u00e9 FPS games. In this sense it is a shame that the developers weren't daring enough to introduce something as revolutionary as the gameplay and graphics managed, and instead opted to take the easy way out.<\/p><p>That said, the notion of Freeman being the reluctant hero does work incredibly well, and the diversity of environments carries through what would otherwise be a pretty mundane and predictable adventure. There is little emotional development of the character of Freeman, which would have been nice to see, as it was a factor also absent from the previous game. This isn't aided by the fact that the character never speaks, or the lack of cinematic cut scenes. You would've thought that Half Life 2 would have been the perfect opportunity to flesh out his role a bit more, but this was not seized. I think that the reasoning behind this was that it was supposed to let the gamer take on the role of Freeman; we see everything from his perspective. However, in my view, instead of achieving this effect, it just made out what potentially could have been a very interesting character, into a rather bland one, devoid of all emotion. But that is nitpicking the concept of the first game just as much as this one, so it is hardly Half Life 2's fault for including this factor of continuity.<\/p><p>Whilst the gameplay and graphics may be some of the best, and clearly show that time and effort have been put into the game, they are not as innovative as what was achieved through the original game. Half Life revolutionised the genre, in many ways it was unfair to pit the sequel up against its predecessor, but it is clear that Half Life 2 makes little effort to reciprocate this notion of trying out something new, and instead goes for the safe approach. This is a boring, but nonetheless understandable option. That said, there are new elements of Half Life 2 that do add a great deal to the enjoyment factor. Vehicles are a neat addition, and definitely help to break up the segments of blasting through hordes of Combine soldiers. The Gravity Gun also adds a whole new aspect to the game, flinging around crates and objects offers an extremely refreshing break from the non-stop action gameplay, and the game itself puts a great deal of emphasis on this weapon as an aid to help solving puzzles and defeating certain enemies. It also gives an opportunity to show off the remarkable physics engine that is in place. This addition I feel is one of the game's strongest, it really adds to the sci-fi aspect of the game and is just plain fun, an element all too lacking in games of the recent generations.<\/p><p>However, another element through which Half Life 2 falls down is the actual difficulty of the game. This is not saying that the game is a walk in the park, by no means is that the case. Particularly on hard mode, you have to be an avid gamer, familiar with the genre, to make it through in one piece. That said, the game is incredibly inconsistent. I found myself frequently getting stuck on puzzles at early points in the game, which was made extremely frustrating by the fact that the learning curve was especially sharp. This was followed by incredibly easy parts that could simply be waltzed through with the aid of a shotgun or other powerful weapon. I think the duration of the game was sufficiently long, but Half Life 2 did not build up the difficulty throughout the experience, and I think it suffers as a result of this. The ending was pitifully easy; I don't know what happened to the frustratingly difficult bosses of old but I want them back. It felt like an achievement to finally complete the game, but it was a hollow achievement. I wanted the difficulty of the game, the time and effort that the developers put in, to culminate at the end with one terrific boss fight. Alas, this was not the case, and if you were expecting an emphatic conclusion, you will be sorely disappointed.<\/p><p>That said, Half Life 2 is still an amazing game in so many different aspects. It is a masterpiece of the modern age, and I advocate that anybody who is even the slightest bit interested in the world of videogames would find something to enjoy in Half Life 2, whether you are a fan of the series, or just starting out. Pure gaming fun throughout; a brilliant feat of development, Half Life 2 would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Mass Effect is an epic sci-fi action RPG from the folks at BioWare. You play as Commander Shepard, the first human to be inducted into the Spectres, a group of elite agents whose goal is to maintain galactic stability at any cost.<br\/> <br\/> Your job is to hunt down Saren, a rogue Spectre Agent who, without giving too much away, wants to use old technology to do bad things. That's the basic gist of the story. And I mean basic. It's near impossible to sum up the story in a few sentences because the Mass Effect universe is just so deep.<br\/> <br\/> You'll constantly be learning new things about the galaxy throughout the entire game, and it seems you can't go two minutes without it dumping a 5-paragraph essay into your Codex describing whatever you were just looking at or talking about in great detail. The Codex is basically an encyclopedia for Mass Effect, and it has thorough descriptions for pretty much everything, ranging from the thrusters on your ship to the reproductive processes of the races in the galaxy.<br\/> <br\/> A lot of your time in Mass Effect will be spent talking to people, and this is where one of the game's defining features comes into play--the conversation wheel. As characters talk to you, you get to select your reaction from a wheel of responses. It's not quite as innovative as it was cooked up to be, as the general formula for most conversations seems to be, 'select the top option for a nice, friendly response and select the bottom option to be a complete prick.' There are some parts of the game where your responses can affect the outcome of the story, but they're usually clearly labeled so it's not really much of a surprise. It's a really cool feature nonetheless.<br\/> <br\/> When you're not talking to characters, you'll usually be exploring the world or fighting, whether it's on-foot or in the Mako rover. On-foot combat is really fun and the game's cover system works well enough. You even have basic control over your squad with the d-pad a-la Rainbow Six: Vegas. Your squad can be a bit dumb at times though, just standing there in the open while enemies pelt them with bullets, despite the fact that there is cover just a few feet away. They also have a habit of stepping right in front of you and getting in your way while you're shooting, which can be a bit of a nuisance. There were also a few bizarre happenings, like my squad not listening to my commands for part of a level, though these issues were few and far between.<br\/> <br\/> While the on-foot combat is pretty good, the Mako combat could use some major improvements. The turret has limited vertical movement, so you have to be on the same level as your enemies to hit them. Problem is, the majority of the planets have constant elevation changes. It's rare that you'll be on the same level as your enemies without being right up in their face, making your vehicle an easy target to hit.<br\/> <br\/> During one of the side quests I had to defeat a bunch of Geth Snipers, Rocket Troopers, and Shock Troopers, all surrounding two Geth Colossi. They were at the bottom of a small valley surrounded by mountains on almost all sides. If I tried to shoot at them in the Mako from the safety of the mountaintops, I couldn't aim low enough to hit them, but if I went down there my Mako would be immediately pelted by gunfire and explode a few seconds later. I just could not pass this part using the darn thing, so eventually I ditched it and ran around on-foot with my shotgun instead (and it worked!). If a shotgun is, at times, more effective than a heavily armed APC, you know the APC can't be that great.<br\/> <br\/> The Mako combat isn't helped by the fact that most of the planets you use it on are just downright boring. Pretty much every planet that isn't a main quest planet is an \"uncharted world,\" meaning a barren planet that usually doesn't have more than a few people living on it. The majority of side quests take place on uncharted worlds, so if you're a completionist you'll be spending a lot of time exploring these planets.<br\/> <br\/> Navigating the worlds is fun at first, but by the time you've done a few of them you start to realize that they're all the same. Every single one is just an empty, rocky environment with a different texture for the ground. Even the buildings on the planets are repetitive. You've got your square base, your circular base, your mine, and a few other structures. These buildings appear on the uncharted worlds and they look exactly the same. If you've been in one circular base, you've been in them all.<br\/> <br\/> This means the side quests are very repetitive as well. The game may give you a different reason to go to each base, but in the end you're just doing the same five things over and over again. Go to an uncharted world, travel to a base, kill some mercenaries, go back to your ship. The next side quest will probably have you doing the exact same thing, but this time the ground on the planet is green rather than brown, and instead of mercenaries there'll be Geth inside the base. And that makes it completely different. No, really.<br\/> <br\/> Mass Effect's problems don't stop there either. The game is also plagued by a hard-to-navigate inventory system. There is a 150 item limit, which will probably be hit about a third of the way into the game. From then on you have to get rid any item you pick up until you make room in your inventory. The inventory system has many small annoyances that make it a pain to use. You can only delete things one at a time, instead of selecting multiple things and deleting them all at once.<br\/> <br\/> In addition, if you have more than one of the same item, it will be listed multiple times in your inventory instead of just once with the quantity next to it. It's really annoying when you want to delete all ten of Item X and have to navigate the entire list to find all of them separately. The inventory also suffers from lack of consistency. When you delete weapons or armor, the cursor will stay in the same place on the list, but if you delete weapon or armor upgrades, the cursor will scroll back up to the top of the list. Since your worst items tend to be at the bottom of the list, this means when you're deleting upgrades, you have to scroll to the bottom of the list over and over again for each item you want to delete.<br\/> <br\/> The game's last problem is the constant texture pop-in and slowdown. Mass Effect is one of the best looking games out for the Xbox 360, but when you're talking to someone and see the background loading behind them it's a bit of an immersion breaker. This is apparently a \"feature\" of Unreal Engine 3, but I own other games that use the engine and none of them have pop-in as prevalent as in Mass Effect. There are also frequent frame rate drops, though they aren't bad enough to make the game unplayable, but once again, it's an immersion breaker.<br\/> <br\/> By this point I'm sure it sounds as if I hate Mass Effect, being that I've been ragging on the game for the past eight paragraphs, but that's not true at all. I loved Mass Effect, but it had a lot of problems that need to be pointed out. In fact, despite all my whining, none of the issues make the game unplayable, and when the game shines, it really shines. Mass Effect has an amazing story and one of the deepest universes I have ever seen in any game, period. Having conversations with NPCs is surprisingly fun, and the combat is pretty good as well. Mass Effect has plenty of room for improvement in the sequels, but even with its problems it's still an amazing game and shouldn't be missed by anyone who even remotely likes story-driven RPGs.<\/p>",

Then came liberty city stories on PS2 ( also a port ) which was a terrible excuse for a GTA game.Now comes victe city stories on the PS2 which a hundred times better than Liberty City Stories.Gameplay is simple and fun you do missions to continue the story ( just like all the others) and free roam around the city doing everything from street racing to building a business empire buy building business ( a new feature) and adding on to them.The charcter is Vic Vance. ( the brother of the charcter that helps the main charcter then turns on him in vice city orginal) He was in the miltary and his Commanding Office made him do drug runing missions ( whcih u get to play) and hide the drugs under your bunk bed. A nother officer cathes you and kicked you out of the miltary onto the streets.You go on a ruthless rampage working for southern hicks to big time drugs lords. Graphics are nice for a PSP to PS2 port.Sounds is good as always with quality voice acting and realistic car and gun sounds.Great radio stations but not so great of a soundtrack this time.The game is extremly cheap for a price of 20 bucks and comes with a cool poster and a instruction manual with funny ads to read.I think anybody who loves GTA our free froam games should pick this one up. <\/p>",

Now the time has finnaly come to play this game.As i firts started out i thought the game was horrid.I then decided to put it away.I got bored again and decided to play thro some more.and WOW was i wrong.AS you progress it gets better.It takes place in chernobyl Ukraine where the power plan blew up in 1986.This takes place in 2012 where a second explosion occurs and mutates humans and animals.You are a STALKER ( hence the name ) a mercanry who finds artefacts made from the anomlies and radation and sells them to others.This game is a FPS\/RPG blend.The game is very tatical and very very hard, not for the casual gamer.Gravity Pulls bullets down so its hard to shoot.There is a system called ALIFE. which gives all AI charcters daily routines and objectives to carry out.As well each faction makes war with each other.The miltary is the enemy to all,they are also hardest to kill becasue they have the best body armor.Graphics are so so on low-medium ( for a medim ranged PC) graphics are nice and detailed on High with low lighting ( for middle to high with no lag) and Very High with Full Dynamic Lighting (for exteremly high PC) ( i can run it on that) are absolutly amazing It actually looks like a Xbox 360 game..almost oblivion like.Sounds are nice but at times annoying with many sounds going all the time...from birds to distant gunfire and explosinns to people talking.Real worl gun sounds are nice and accurate.Voice acting is chezzy at times but are cool to with Russian accents.The game is 39 bucks right now ( dont expect price drop soon) and comes with a special map depends where u by it. I have both codes...Best buy has 1 map and Eb games does to.This game will give hours of fun and free roam exploration. <\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Metal Gear Sold 4 is by far a noble prize winning game of the century in my books. The game quickly pulls you in close and together you both share a special bond with each other. The fact that not only gameplay is supurb but aswell the storyline. Aside from those two the graphics are astounding with beautiful to destruction scenery. The game would not be classified as a game but instead as a memorable experience that Old Snake and you have gone through together from the start and end.<br\/><br\/>My review must already be clear to you, I rate this game to the highest number there is. My reasons are mainly for the breath taking storyline. I laughed and struggled through parts of the story with Snake. Everything falls into place, no cliff hanging \"what if..\"s. I understood everything as I reached the final part in the story, even which they also integrated the Nintendo and Portable Ops storyline with this game. <br\/><br\/>I am proud to say that I had cried at the end, not just for the last line of the Metal Gear Solid franchise but mainly for the storyline. I cried in front of my friend and my brother.<br\/><br\/>Anyways, the new upgraded revolutionary type of concealment, OctoCamo suit which Octagon has made for Snake in his way to save the planet, is by far the greatest tool in stealth. Weapon laundering, which is introduced to you by the weapons dealer Drebin, and also \"pimping\" out your armory with a vass variety of add-ons is genious! All new additions completely go together like peas and carrots.<br\/><br\/>My finale score is obvious..<br\/>5\/5<br\/><\/p>",

(I suppose it might be worth mentioning that the new movie is not included in this game)<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">This title sees Indy through his original adventures in all their glory, sans a few key scenes to maintain their ESRB rating to be sure.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Those hoping for the classic face melting and heart ripping will be sadly left wanting.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Other then that however, the game does a great job letting you relive the classic trilogy.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The level environments are wonderfully done and the addition of the complete original music makes you really feel like part of the action.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>They add a particularly nice touch for the level loading screen which shows you the traversed path between level locations on a map just like in the movies.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Indy and the cast have impressively well detailed movement animations that really go a long way in a silent game.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>They even go as far as to showcase a new character phobia mechanic where certain characters have these fears of certain things, like Indy and snakes.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>These fears force you to find other avenues to help get frightened characters across perilous paths.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This adds a new layer of dynamic realism that helps get that complete movie adaptation across.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>A throwing mechanic has also been added, since we can\u2019t all have force push powers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This mechanic is pretty spot on and includes an auto targeting feature so you can easily hurl a sword through a rope to gain access to a special area.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span

different class types where certain characters possess certain abilities.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This time around, the classes are much more robust.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Abilities include an explosives expert who is essential in destroying certain types of Lego blocks to gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas, a glyph reader who can use his blue book to decipher secret messages on the walls, female characters who can jump higher then any other character and some are even able to break glass with their screams of peril, and of course Indy himself whose specialties with a whip allow you to manipulate certain environments.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The shorter characters return as well to help you through the game along with run of the mill gunmen.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Helping you to identify when special characters are needed, the game provides a small glowing patch of ground to indicate there is an interactive aspect near.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is also especially useful when using ropes.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The ropes and vines produce a small circle of light to help you determine exactly where in the environment they are.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Though this feature doesn\u2019t make up for the terrible camera, (this is the next generation here and every game should have a player controlled camera environment!) it does help a little with prospective problems.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">A fixed camera is not the only problem that plagues this recent trip down the Lego aisle.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Fans of the genre will note that the game still lacks in the playing time department.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sure there are a few (Three) bonus levels out there but that only brings the total up to 21, a far cry away from the standards these days.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>You are also going to miss that lightsaber in combat situations.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Indy sports a newly revamped fighting system and though it is nice to look at, comes across more cumbersome then anything else.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is mainly due to everyone else having a gun and you left with a whip.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sure it is cool to fling your whip around, but let me tell you, your whip isn\u2019t going to scare those bullets flying towards you!<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The frustration of this system becomes overwhelmingly clear when you continually find yourself being shot by someone off screen.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>And don\u2019t look to your AI controlled counterpart for help, the only thing he or she will be good for is stunning a foe momentarily.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>The baddies always go for player one first, as apposed to the most prominent threat.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is due to poor AI programming or an attempt at throwing all the action at the player, you decide.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you are fighting with one of three guys, the other one or two will work on your counterpart (it is sort of like a dance seeing as neither one ever gets killed) then immediately following the demise of the foe you were working on, the others steer their attention away from your buddy and set sights on you.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>You have to wonder why the developer chose this almost infantile form of combat tactics.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>That doesn\u2019t equal out to an enjoyable experience.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Throw in a few annoying puzzles, not all of them mind you just a few, and you will have an idea of what aspects this game falls short in.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">If you thoroughly enjoyed the other branches in the Lego family tree, this one is sure to add an afternoon of excitement in your family home.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>It is nice to see how they can shake up their formula to incorporate different styles of gameplay specifically for different movie adaptations.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Even though some aspects are bad, overall the game is still improving on the original foundations.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Taking the limitations aside and looking past the obvious \u201cmilking the cash cow\u201d routine, this game really is fun and the only thing that truly hurts it is that it is so dang short.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>One long afternoon is all you need to see everything it has to offer.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Luckily they throw in a few bonus levels and characters, stretching it out to two afternoons.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Maybe.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0 <\/span>Regardless, true fans of the growing phenomenon that is lego-ized IPs will no doubt be completely satisfied with this new addition and at a discounted price, it defiantly isn\u2019t the worst game you could buy.<br\/>6 out of 10 &gt; \"Fun\"\u00a0 (I use a 10 point sytem but Giant Bomb uses a 5 Star system so I suppose this equals out to a 3)<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<div class=\"content lh16 cl pb10\"> Talk to any gamer old enough to have owned a NES, and they will invariably tell you about how much they loved Kid Icarus. The game is regarded as a classic, and rarely a day passes without someone on the forums clamoring for a sequel. Now that the game is available for the Wii's virtual console, it's tough not to wonder why the game is held in such high regard.<br\/> <br\/> Kid Icarus is best described as a mix between a side-scrolling shooter and a platformer, incorporating elements of both. The angel Pit, your character, will have to jump from ledge to ledge and use his magic bow to fight off enemies from Hell itself. While the premise isn't all that original, it's decent, and nothing to hold against the game.<br\/> <br\/> The rest of Kid Icarus is a completely different story. A sadistic difficulty level, infinitely spawning enemies, and low health are the most blatant offenders, although far from the only culprits. As Pit ascends from platform to platform he must fight off his enemies with his bow. here is where the problems begin: missing a platform and falling to the bottom of the screen means instant death. It's impossible to backtrack and pick up an item or enter a door you may have missed, and enemies will spawn infinitely until you advance past their spawn point.<br\/> <br\/> Fighting off enemies is a simple matter of shooting them with your bow, but even that is tougher than it sounds. Pit's arrows don't travel very far, meaning to kill an enemy you must be practically touching it, which, for obvious reasons, doesn't end well most of the time. When killed, enemies leave behind hearts which can be used to purchase upgrades and items in the game's rare shops. Some of these upgrades (Such as additional health) serve to make the game easier, but they are so difficult to obtain, it's a moot point. The rest of the game is as afflicted as the basic gameplay. Small, bland, barely animated sprites that weren't all that impressive even back during the time of the NES comprise the graphics, which hold up horribly. A single-color background and some platforms to jump between is all the scenery you'll be taking in on your journey, and the chirping, repetitive music that accompanies the bland sprites certainly doesn't help.<br\/> <br\/> Overall, Kid Icarus is a sadistically difficult game, that doesn't deserve it's reputation as a classic. Underwhelming graphics, even at the time of it's release, poor sound, and bad gameplay combine to form Kid Icarus. As if adding insult to injury, Nintendo has removed several of the cheat codes from the original game, and hasn't even bothered to remove the slowdown that occurs when multiple enemies crowd the screen. Kid Icarus was a mediocre game when it released in 1987, and it's no better now, 20 years later. <\/div>",

      "description": "<div class=\"content lh16 cl pb10\"> Coded Arms got a lot of hype as the first First Person Shooter to be released for Sony's PlayStation Portable handheld. The game was regarded with some uncertainty, as gamers were uncertain that the PSP could pull off a shooter without a second analog stick. As has been proven with more recent games, it certainly can; however Coded Arms is simply not a shining example of what the PSP platform can do.<br\/> <br\/> The game does not allow for the controls to be re-vamped to custom settings, but it does however provide several control schemes for you to choose from. The default setting has you moving with the analog stick, and aiming with the face buttons. This setup is trash, allowing for little control or precision. The best option available is to move with the face buttons, and aim with the analog stick. It works decently, but then we run into the games next problem: it is very, very imprecise. Those who don't believe FPS can be done properly on consoles would be having fits over Coded Arms. The game features sticky aim, akin to a rather weak lock-on, but even with that, it's maddening to attempt to wrestle your reticule over your enemy, only to have them move again, and begin the whole dance all over. The control is not broken, but totally imprecise. You'll get wasted by little flying bugs, who should be dispatched in seconds, because you simply cant target them. The PSP's aggravating sliding analog stick simply compounds your problems.<br\/> <br\/> This might be bearable, if you were traversing exotic locales and urban jungles, at least able to take in the scenery. Instead, Coded Arms insists on using randomly generated environments, so \"Every playthrough is unique.\" Honestly though, they should have made sure this game was worth playing twice, before they started worrying about it getting repetitive. And repetitive it is. The environments might be random, but they all share the same characteristics. Metal room with moss covered walls. Okay. Onwards to a... metal room with moss covered walls. The games graphics do an adequate job, but there really isn't much impressive in Coded Arms. You'll see some massive bosses, and some large enemies, but the imagery doesn't really rise above average.<br\/> <br\/> Coded Arms features some nice sounds for weapons, and some ambient sounds, but it's music is really nothing to comment on. You'll find yourself forgetting the tunes seconds after they're played. Probably the most impressive sound you'll hear in Coded Arms is the sound your metal boots make against the floor as you walk through a silent corridor.<br\/> <br\/> However dull Coded Arms is, it still has some value, ironically due to the randomly generating maps which make the rest of it so bland. The game doesn't bother with a story, besides a small paragraph or two in the manual, but you can play forever, not see the same room twice. Why you'd want to is another matter, but if you're one of those people who likes to compulsively play bad games, the option is there.<br\/> <br\/> Coded Arms is a bad game. There's no way around it. It's dull, it's unimaginative, it's horribly frustrating, and it never realizes the full potential of the PSP system. The game simply isn't much fun. The controls are not crippling, but they denote the quality of the rest of the game, which is, to say the least, dismal. Coded Arms is bland, and aggravating, and does neither the genre, nor the platform, justice. <\/div> <br class=\"cb\"\/>",

      "description": "<div class=\"content lh16 cl pb10\">Well this is Ninja Gaiden Sigma(and some crooked M:)) and it is basically a remake of Ninja Gaiden for the regular Xbox.The main thing that this one adds is the ability to play as Rachel and some other add ons were you can shoot arrows in mid-air,and fight on water surfaces and that was all.Well I watched the great KVO video review of this and he said that the difficulty was scaled down a little bit...and that meanie!He lied....but that is just my opinion he is probably much more skilled at video games then me so he could probably tell the difficulty change.I want to really get all the bad out of the way so.Well the camera is absouloutly the worst I've saw in a game.While the sword play may get repetitive to some,I found it very exciting and bloody...real bloody...really bloody :) yeahhhh blood.But they might get bored because they will just say you hack you slash you die you restart you hack you slash then you kill them.But I find it very fun to block a attack roll out the way and jump in the air and press triangle in which it will make Ryu fly across the screeen in a second and be-head the oppenent.Next is the graphics.They are superb with from what I've saw no frame rate drops everything is smooth and beautiful.The controls are very smooth.Just press down with the D-Pad and you'll heal some health and all the UT's are really fun.The story in this one in not brilliantly great but it is a lot better then some other games that have got more praise then this(ie Halo 2).The level design is beautiful,you'll see many amazing looking enviroments and you'll see some really gritty enviroments.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Multiplayer:~None~<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Re-play value:Well the story is good and the fights are brutal but you wont want to go through this one more than two times.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>End it!All-in-all this is a great game that at the price it is at now deserves a buy.Even if you haven't played a Ninja Gaiden game in your life,this is a great start<\/div>",

      "description": "<p>Civilization Revolution is like going to your favorite restaurant and ordering your favorite dish only to have the waiter hand you 1\/2 of your order and walk away.<br\/><br\/>Civ Rev is a good game, especially for console owners who haven't had the pleasure of playing Civilization IV or any of the expansions but to those who have experienced what the PC games were like, Civ Rev will feel stripped and might have you jump back on your PC to satisfy your craving for world conquest. The game does feel tailored for consoles and doesn't feel like a bad port, but they did remove some key diplomatic features of the game like forming alliances and non-agression pacts, etc. and pretty much streamlined the gameplay to allow for quicker and hassle-free matches. You can no longer directly control workers, however you can still dictate the production of a particular city's resources, so you can opt for gold instead of production or leave it balanced at default, etc.<br\/><br\/>Much of the core gameplay was left intact. You still have your tech trees that you need to progress through and building cities still rely on picking out a good location. The maps are always randomly generated which helps to keep things fresh through each playthrough but you can't pick the diverse settings of how the world will be shaped as like in the PC version. After a handful of matches, you'll start to notice that the world is generally broken into small-sized continents which can sometimes be too small for two or more civilizations to grow properly without fighting.<br\/><br\/>The A.I. can be a tough opponent but after awhile you'll start to notice that most, if not all, are overly aggressive. Things might be peaceful for the first part of the game and then out of nowhere a civilization will demand almost all of your gold or a certain tech in exchange for x number of turns of peace. It's like having a peace treaty but before the war, so it doesn't really make sense and knowing how many turns you have left of peaceful conditions kinda ruins any peaceful intentions without feeling like being pushed around. Anyway, this type of gameplay was fun at first but it got annoying later on since all I was doing was defending \/ attacking other nations about 1\/3 into the game.<br\/><br\/>The multiplayer experience can be more of a challenge, like most games, and is built really well. The built-in VOIP lets you smack-talk, negotiate, smack-talk, plead for peace, smack-talk, talk behind someone's back, etc. which is a cool feature to have for a Civ game. The matches can be fairly long however, but if a player leaves the AI will just take over until the game is finished.<br\/><br\/>Graphics are from the Civ IV engine but they still look good on the big screen. Sound and music are nothing to brag about but they serve their purpose. Animations are done fairly well and the engagements are always fun to watch thanks to the updated fight animations where each unit will scatter across the tile as they fight the enemy.<br\/><br\/>Overall - This game is a nice breath of fresh air in the console market but if you're looking for a more complete, polished, and deeper version of the game do yourself a favor and pickup the PC version already.<br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">For anyone who has lost faith in the straight single player game in a world of online multiplayer madness, Assassin's Creed is that glimmer of hope you may be searching for. Finally there is a highly satisfying, and richly developed game that has been designed from the ground up to be a solo adventure like non other. This game shows you what a \"current gen\" one-player game can be and raises the bar for what is possible. You will find yourself with many moments of sheer excitement as you play through the twisting storyline that Assassin's Creed lays before you. Though it is not a perfect game, what little flaws it possesses are few and far between and don't really affect the overall enjoyment of this tale.<br\/><br\/>In Assassin's Creed, you first find yourself playing the role of Desmond, a normal run of the mill bartender, who has been abducted by some highly industrialized tech company. You find out that they don't really want Desmond they just want his genetic memories, the memories of Alta\u00efr. This is how the game works. You spend some time in a side story as Desmond, before being thrown into the real game to play as Alta\u00efr, the main character. This works by Desmond in essence reliving a genetic memory of Alta\u00efr through the means of an Animus, a machine which links to Desmond's brain and allows him to relive his ancestor's memories. With all that explanation aside, this two-sided story approach is really an interesting way of organizing the games seven chapters. In the beginning you really don't understand at all what is going on in the \"futuristic\" storyline, but that is intentional. As you progress you find out more and more, piecing together the puzzle of this side story. That leads us to the first big flaw in the game, the ending. I suppose it's not really a flaw, more bad taste in design. Anyone who is familiar with the ending to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back would have a good idea of the way this story ends. Basically it leads up to some big event that never happens. Since the story starts and ends in this side story that leaves it as a bit of a let down. However the main story of the game does have an ending, which is satisfying if not entirely predictable.<br\/><br\/>On a gameplay standpoint this game delivers an intense experience. The mix of stealth and action really does go far beyond what Kojima first invented in MGS. To augment the sneaking around, you have four ways to deal with those pesky guards: secret blade, sword, fists, and the short sword\/throwing knife combo. You will find a use of all of these as your skills advance. The secret blade is just amazingly satisfying to use and you won't easily tire of it. The game provides a nice cinematic camera touch in key moments when using this blade or performing an equally nice counter kill during a sword fight. Sword fights are not particularly impressive but they do add a different dynamic when faced with no other option and flow fairly smoothly. There are in fact moments when you must face off against a group of guards who enjoy surrounding you and wait for you to attempt to attack one, leaving you vulnerable for a slash across your backside. This can be frustrating for those who enjoy hack and slash sword fighting because timing is everything. If you are off with your timing you are going to get mowed down. This is an example of emphasizing details. The game plays a convincing role in realism details, such as the games use of maps. Basically you have to put together a map of an area from scratch. To do this you must climb to the top of the highest buildings in the city and surveying the surrounding area. That area is then added to a map. There are usually around 10 per area. You might think this to become tedious, and it would, if it wasn't so much fun to do. It truly is just fun to watch Alta\u00efr scale this huge building, perch onto a ledge and take in the sights, before taking a \"leap\" into a conveniently placed pile of hay. That hay plays an important role in the game. <br\/><br\/>The main idea here is stealth, get to know the area, gather information on the target, and assassinate all without being detected by the numerous city guards. There are three different states of awareness: the regular state which is basically no guards around, the yellow state where there is a guard around, and the red state when the guards are watching you. The first two states you really don't have to be that careful, it's the last one that will make them wise to what you are. If you do manage to alert them to your presence, and this is increasingly easy to do as you progress through the story, you only have two options: rely on your sword to take down anywhere from one to a dozen if not more guards that are pursuing you until you are no longer suspected, or the games more supported tactic, run. You must run taking turns at high speeds trying to elude your pursuers. Once they cannot see you, you are then tasked with finding a good hiding place until they give up. You will find that sitting on a bench, blending in with scholars or hiding in a pile of hay can prove most useful in eluding your captors. If no pile of hay is available, take to the roofs and hide in one of the convenient covered gardens. In fact the best way to get away from the heat is the rooftops. All in all the whole system of blending in and sneaking around is highly enjoyable and leaves you feeling quite superior. <br\/><br\/>Satisfaction is delivered on all fronts of this amazing title. Side notes to mention are the fact that though it is great to have in engine cut scenes, you also need a way to skip through them. They become annoying at best on a second play through of any particular chapter. Speaking of a second play through, there really isn't much of a need for it. There isn't much replay value unless you are just itching to find every single last flag in the game. The fact that you have to play the entire chapter over again and cannot just pick up in one spot doesn't help. You might as well just play the whole thing again from start to finish. The whole game won't take you an incredible amount of time to get through but it is a game worth playing if not owning just for its sheer mastery. Through the ingenious gameplay and attention to detail, UbiSoft has delivered to us an experience like non other. The drawbacks aside this is a game worth every penny and it gets a 9 out of 10 only because of the problems it has with the PS3 engine. A 9 out of 10 is \"Above and Beyond\" in my rating system and that is exactly what this game goes.<br\/>(I use a 10 point scale so with Giant Bomb's 5 point system it equals out to a 4.5)<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>This truly is a masterpiece. The artwork and the graphics are beautiful for such an old game (10 years at the time of writing!). I recently picked this up because a friend recommended it and it was a fantastic recommendation. For a mere $20 I got both Starcraft and the expansion plus both guide books. The online play is fun and addictive with amazing longevity due to it being free, easy to use and includes a very good map editor\/maker (which the community has really got into). Most of the games i enjoyed online are not even the normal game modes. To be honest I haven\u2019t actually gone into the single player for there is so much more in the online play! The obvious flaw I find is just a couple of annoyances such as the \u201cselecting 12 max units rule\u201d and some other minor problems. These will all be fixed in the next installment. For me, they don't even need to change that much to create another piece of perfection. <br\/> <br\/> Well worth purchasing and remember this is based only on online play so there probably is a bundle of more fun in the campaign!<\/p>",

The gameplay has been tightened up and vastly improved, but underneath that, all that gamers have come to expect from the Metal Gear Solid series remains. Convoluted plot lines, unbelievable twists, out of this world characters and nanomachines are all still present in MGS4. Despite being fundamentally the same as its predecessors, MGS4 gets my vote for being the best in the series. <\/b><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>As pretty much everybody knows by this stage, MGS4 will be the last Metal Gear game to feature Solid Snake. For most other game characters, this may not necessarily be that big a deal, but for Solid Snake it is. To many gamers, even those who have never touched a Metal Gear game, he has become something like a legend \u2013 a feat he has achieved independent of each Metal Gear\u2019s previous instalments\u2019 insistence that he is a legend of the battlefield. Speaking of which, you will be glad to know that by the end of MGS4, you will have found out whether love can bloom on the battlefield. Anyway, Snake is pretty much already a legend in gaming. This comes from being the lead character of a highly acclaimed series which, at this stage, has spanned a good twenty years. In that context, it is quite saddening that MGS4 will be the final chapter in his life within gaming. Luckily, Hideo Kojima has provided Snake with a fitting end to his career which makes MGS4 close to being perfect, at least for fans of the series.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Unlike nearly every game out there, the strength of MGS4 is not the game per se. Instead, one gets the feeling that the majority of the emphasis is placed on the story. Although, by this stage in the series, that should be expected. Also as in previous Metal Gear games, the plot is as convoluted as ever, with more twists in it than the wiring shoved behind your TV stand. The script, at times, is poor. In fact it can get so over the top and melodramatic, that even the biggest Metal Gear fan will probably wish they had employed at least one decent editor. That said, most of the time, the unnecessarily dramatic script fits the unnecessarily dramatic story and cut scenes, so maybe there was no editor for a reason. Nearly every character who means anything in the MGS universe makes an appearance in MGS4, except those who are dead. Actually, even some of them have been thrown into the mix somewhere. <\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>If you hadn\u2019t already noticed, much of what drives the story, and the manner in which it is driven, hasn\u2019t changed in MGS4 compared to any of the older games. Perhaps the biggest change is that the codec conversations have been scaled back considerably. Gone are the boring codec conversations that last forever, serving to tell the player of a secret society of some sort. Instead, much more of the story is told via cut scenes. For a game with such high production values and a unique cinematic feel, thus undoubtedly works to the games favour.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>As already mentioned, a number of the series\u2019 better known characters reappear in MGS4. Obviously those include Solid Snake, Otacon, the Colonel and Ocelot, but there are also others who are still alive and need to have their stories concluded. Characters such as Meryl, Raiden and Vamp fall into this category. There are a number of others, but to say who might be to give away some of the more interesting plot twists of the game. Perhaps the biggest surprise in terms of the characters is that Raiden is actually a pretty cool character this time round. Gone are his feminine looks and tight fitting \u2018sneaking suit.\u2019 Instead, he sports a distinctly \u2018ninja\u2019 looking outfit, complete with sword and a futuristic looking helmet thing. Other characters don\u2019t feel like they fit in quite as well as Raiden, unfortunately. As mentioned, pretty much all characters still alive appear and this makes for some fairly odd moments where, even by Metal Gear standards, it just feels like they shouldn\u2019t be there. They just don\u2019t fit in with the context of when they\u2019re introduced into MGS4. Ultimately, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that Kojima chose to put them in just to keep fans happy. I\u2019m trying to talk around specifics here so as not to spoil the game, but once you play these parts of the game, what I\u2019m getting at should become a little bit clearer [hopefully].<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>So the story is still as prominent as ever? Yes. But if this isn\u2019t your cup of tea, don\u2019t despair just yet, as the gameplay in MGS4 is easily the best in any Metal Gear game to date. One of my biggest criticisms of the past games, especially Snake Eater, was the camera. Its fixed position made it unnecessarily difficult to see your surroundings. Sure, Naked Snake was missing an eye but I\u2019m pretty sure that doesn\u2019t stop you from, say, looking in more than one direction. Luckily, this has been remedied in MGS4. The camera, like most conventional third person shooters, can be controlled with the right analogue stick. The camouflage is also much better than on previous games. Yes, I\u2019m looking at you MGS3. Whereas before, crawling from one shade of grey to another required a laborious trek through multi-layered menus just to change your face paint, Kojima has thankfully implemented a more adaptable camouflage system in MGS4, whereby the \u2018Octocamo\u2019 suit automatically adapts to your surroundings.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>As for the actual gameplay of killing people, there is not as much tactical espionage in MGS4. It\u2019s actually quite easy to run n gun your way through, although you can maintain stealth if preferred. In the first two locations, different factions will be fighting each other. This adds an interesting gameplay dynamic because you now must evade two sets of guards or at least ally yourself with one of them. This is undoubtedly MGS4\u2019s best new feature, and if the story hasn\u2019t drawn you into the series thus far, this might. Or it might not since it suddenly disappears about half way though the game never to return. At this point, the game becomes very story driven. In other words, the new promise that MGS4 exhibits towards the beginning, is extinguished by the time you reach the half way mark.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>To start with, this is a shame. The first level without two factions is easily the worst in the game. Firstly, you do hardly any playing in this area, and when you do play, it isn\u2019t exactly riveting stuff. If you hadn\u2019t guessed, this is where non-MGS fans will lose interest and realise why they don\u2019t like MGS. On the other hand, MGS fans will be happy for a return to normalcy, having enjoyed the variety in the first half of the game. Despite the lack of actual playing in the second half, fans will probably enjoy this part more, due largely to the locations and characters.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Based on this, I think it\u2019s a fair judgement to say that MGS4 is for fans of MGS. If you\u2019re not, don\u2019t bother. The gameplay is sufficiently unique to be fun for the first 8 hours of play, but thereafter you may as well go watch a conspiracy theory movie, complete with UFO\u2019s and New World Orders.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This leads me to a dilemma. How do you score a game which one group of people will despise, whilst another group will adore it? I\u2019ll let you come to your own conclusion on that one, but in answer to my own semi-rhetorical question, my solution is to give two scores.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Presentation: 10\/10<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Gameplay: 9\/10<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Story: 9.5\/10<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Longevity: 9\/10<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Overall (for fans): 10\/10<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Overall (for non-fans): 8\/10<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Oh and there\u2019s also this thing called Metal Gear Online which isn\u2019t that good. Every aspect of it feels like it came from the local discount store \u2013 it gets the job done, and that\u2019s about it. If MGO were to be summed up in one word, it would be \u2018mediocre.\u2019 Honestly, there are better online games out there. I also got turned off straight away by the signing in process, which require registration on Konami\u2019s website and obtaining TWO login ID\u2019s between which you\u2019ll get confused in about 120 seconds. That MGO is little more than a money grabbing exercise by Konami is pretty obvious too. You can\u2019t have more than one account per PS3 without paying. <i>You can\u2019t even change you one characters facial features without being charged<\/i>. Altogether, not very good.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>MGO: 6.5\/10<\/span><\/p>",

The interface has been tuned for gamepads, squad commands have been trimmed, and a new game mode has been introduced, but this is unmistakably a Battlefield game.<\/p> <p style=\"margin:0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px\"><br\/><\/p> <p style=\"margin:0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Bitstream Vera Serif\">The new Gold Rush multiplayer game mode is a welcome improvement over previous games in the series. Instead of a number of checkpoints reachable at all times, this new mode focuses on one at a time, leading to more intense battles.\u00a0\u00a0Despite lack of explicit squad commands, multiplayer gameplay is more tactical than ever, as Gold Rush rewards defense and cooperation over hit-an-run game styles so common in earlier games.<\/p> <p style=\"margin:0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px\"><br\/><\/p> <p style=\"margin:0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Bitstream Vera Serif\">No game is perfect, and Bad Company suffers from a few glitches. At least twice the game has lockup up completely, requiring a reset. Additionally, the PSN demo version also had problems with sounds disappearing and users unable to move. These issues seem to have been fixed in the final version though. Finally, the game has one glaring user interface problem: users can not choose to turn off voice chat, which means that the a noisy user, or one with a bad microphone, can easily ruin the game.<\/p> <p style=\"margin:0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px; min-height: 16.0px\"><br\/><\/p> <p style=\"margin:0.0px 0.0px 6.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Bitstream Vera Serif\">These are minor issues though. Overall this is a fantastic multiplayer game, with finely tuned and varied gameplay, with fun vehicles, a wealth of unlocks and achievements, and cleverly designed maps.\u00a0Bad Company is the most polished, fun, chaotic and good looking game in the series so far, and the new gold standard for console multiplayer shooters.\u00a0<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Grand Theft Auto IV is not radically different to its last generation predecessors. It only introduces a handful of new features, many of which are fairly minor. You still commit thefts, assaults and murders in return for money. You still have to work for untrustworthy criminals who might stab you in the back at any time. You're still in . But GTA IV is better than its predecessors. It may be built on the same concept, but this time round, all of the small nuts and bolts that put GTA together are of much better quality, and fit much more closely together.<\/b><br\/> <br\/> The game begins as you, Niko Bellic, step off a boat at the  docks as an illegal immigrant in search of fortune, women and fast cars. All of this has been promised by Niko's cousin, Roman, who you meet almost immediately. However, it quickly transpires that Roman has been living in a dream world and has been falsely promoting . In reality, far from living a life of luxury, Roman has been living in a small, untidy one bedroom apartment and runs a small taxi service which apparently struggles to turn over any substantial amount of money. Unimpressed with his cousin's lies, and with little choice, Niko is thrust into the criminal underworld which is prosperous in  \u2013 hardly surprising if you know anything about the GTA series.<br\/> <br\/> It is difficult to pinpoint one feature of GTAIV which is better, or more compelling than any other. If one were forced to choose, the characters, the story or the city would be equally valid choices. However, perhaps the biggest improvement over previous GTA games is in the characters. Whereas in previous GTA instalments, characters could, at times, be a little too eccentric and thus unbelievable, this time round, they are, in most cases, nearly spot on. Every character is well developed in a way not usually seen in video games. By the time you have completed a few missions for each character, you should have a good understanding of what that character believes in, why they are who they are and what sets them apart from the other characters. The range of characters is also hugely diverse, from the jacked up, steroid fuelled Brucie to the marijuana smoking Jamaican, Little Jacob, to the gambling addict, Roman. What's more, each of the main characters are often more closely related in GTA IV than in previous games, something which proves interesting in latter stages of the story. Depending on how much you are drawn to big name actors, you may be disappointed to learn that there are no famous voice actors in GTA IV \u2013 no Samuel L. Jackson this time around.<br\/> <br\/> With so many characters to do missions for, hang out with, and chat with, it is not easy to keep up to date on all of their situations. Luckily, this task is made a little easier via the new additions of both a cell phone and internet cafes. Your cell phone is accessible at any time (yes, even when driving) and can be used to call associates, ask for help, enquire about jobs for extra money and to invite friends out. The internet is also used to communicate with friends \u2013 although you cannot send them messages, you must wait until they send you one and then hit reply. As well as creating the ability to send emails, the internet is another medium for supplying players with a healthy dose of jokes and funny websites.<br\/> <br\/> Equally as impressive as the characters which have been created, is  itself. Or rather,   and .   is based heavily on real life , whilst Alderney is based upon real life . GTA III was also set in  , but on this excursion,  is almost unrecognisable and has been greatly transformed to the point where it pretty much resembles NYC as closely as possible without actually being NYC. As well as Alderney,   features four distinct districts; Broker (Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (The Bronx) and Algonquin (). These districts have there own unique feel to them, so if you make the transition from one to another, it is quite obvious. This is especially true if you a flying overhead in a helicopter. Also within each district are a number of landmarks. For example, Algonquin features the Statue of Happiness (sorry, no prizes for guessing which real life landmark it is based on), and the  connects Broker to Algonquin. GTA IV's  is not as large as San Andreas, so don't go out expecting to get a bigger world just because the game is more recent. That, said, there are no 'empty' areas in . Unlike the vast deserts in San Andreas,  is a crowded, busy city which is densely populated with people, buildings and roads.<br\/> <br\/> Small details in  make it feel like a real city. Pedestrians will go about their daily business, provided you don't give them a reason to either attack you or speed away in fear. Food stands are dotted around the city \u2013 an ideal place to restore your health. The subway is more complex too, to the extent it actually requires a real map of the subway system in the GTA IV box. Police Officers can sometimes be seen making arresting other people and occasionally there are traffic accidents, including the running over of unfortunate pedestrians \u2013 all these occurrences happen independently of anything you as the player do, again adding to a sense of realism. As a result of this added realism, it seems like a much bigger thing to have to kill people. You no longer necessarily feel you are just shooting a bunch of pixels on a screen. The people you kill may not be real, but they are real enough within the game for you to care about them. Similarly, sometimes you feel genuinely sorry if you accidentally run somebody over, killing them. Thankfully, if you do do this, at least you get more realistic animations thanks to the RAGE engine. This allows people, Niko included, to act differently in every collision, based on how fast you get hit, at what angle, the size of the car etc. It even allows for drivers to be thrown through the windscreens of vehicles in particular heavy collisions.<br\/> <br\/> As mentioned,  has quite a bit going on. So to get from one place to another, you're going to need some transport. One of the first things you will notice when you play GTA IV is how different the cars feel from previous GTA's. Sure, each car has always been different in terms of design and their performance properties, but in GTA IV the difference is much more noticeable. The feel of the cars weight is much more noticeable. This makes braking take longer, and also means that if you do like power sliding around corners, expect the slide to last a lot longer. At first this will probably mean you crash a lot, and the new driving model is a bit more difficult than before, but once you get used to it you begin to appreciate it, even if it is harder to master. As always, you can also catch public transport. As well as the aforementioned subway, GTA IV introduced taxis. Of course, taxis were always there, but now you can pay to ride in them. This is very simple. After hailing an empty taxi, you press a button to get in, tell the driver where to go, and they take you there (duh!). You can pay more money to skip the journey, which makes getting from one corner of the city to the other a much faster experience than before. If you do need to drive such distances on your own, this is made much easier in GTA IV via the use of GPS. Basically, you plot where you want to go on the map, and the GPS shows you the quickest (legal) route to get to your destination.<br\/> <br\/> An area of past GTA IV games which has often let the series down is the combat. The auto aim in particular felt a bit broken and there was never really a way to shield yourself from bullets whilst aiming and shooting back at the same time. Luckily, this has been addressed in GTA IV. You can now employ the use of a cover system during intense shootouts with 'peacekeeping officers.' It's quite simply \u2013 press R1 to take cover, L2 to auto aim, R2 to shoot. The auto aim also allows for a degree of manual aiming, so headshot are quite easy (a little too easy, actually). Additionally, the hand to hand combat is improved, and you can now kick, punch and counter enemies' attacks. You can even disarm an enemy if they are wielding a knife. Unfortunately, the auto aiming system still isn't perfect. Especially in close quarters, it can be difficult to lock on or see who you are aiming at. For example, if a cop gets the jump on you at close range, it can be difficult to lock on and shoot them due to them being within such close proximity to you. Also, throwing grenades can be a little hit and miss. On a number of occasions, you may find yourself aiming a grenade in a particular direction, only for Niko to throw it into a wall next to yourself. These issues aside, the cover system still works well 90% of the time, and is certainly an improvement over how it previously was.<br\/> <br\/> As usual, there a tonne of side missions and secrets to find in the game in order to reach 100% completion. However, most players will be more concerned with the story \u2013 and it doesn't disappoint. The story is more believable in GTA IV than you may have come to expect from the series. There is no breaking into Area 51, no flying jetpacks and no jumping out of planes. However, this is not all bad. The added realism suits GTA IV and complements it's more realistic setting. The story is pretty engaging, and tends to feel more like a film. This is probably due to the better character development in GTA IV than what you are used to seeing in GTA games. Cut scenes really convey more about characters now, and being able to go out and do activities with characters allows you to learn more about them. Unlike a film though, GTA IV is more thought provoking. This is largely as a result of a new addition to the series \u2013 the ability to make choices throughout the story. Whilst most missions will still tell you exactly what to do, a few of them allow you to make decisions, such as whether or not to kill somebody. These decisions grow in importance throughout, and you will be left with some genuinely difficult decisions to make. Most of these decisions to not drastically alter the way the story goes, although they do allow for two possible endings for the story. However, personally I found both endings a bit of a let down compared to the quality narrative of the story up until then. I found it a little predictable and also a bit clich\u00e9d. With the rest of the story being so good, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. The story is also quite lengthy though. If you just focus on the main story, most players would finish it in about 25-35 hours. If you take your time and explore other areas of the game whilst doing the story, though, you can easily get 50-60 hours out of the game.<br\/> <br\/> GTA IV is also the first in the series to offer online multiplayer for up to 16 other wanna be criminals. It works well enough, with a range of modes which include the standard deathmatch, cops n crooks and some interesting yet repetitive co-op missions only available online. It is also novel to be able to use the whole of  to wreak havoc on one another via the use of various weapons and vehicles (or, using vehicles as weapons). Ultimately though, the online aspect isn't great, and can best be described as an added bonus to the single player experience \u2013 I would not recommend GTA IV on its multiplayer alone. I found it difficult to join any type of game, typically getting disconnected immediately and being kicked back into single player. When I did join a game, it was quite enjoyable, but the game did suffer from frequent bouts of lag, especially when players started getting hit by cars at high speeds which were being driven by other players. This happens a lot, too, as most players immediate instinct is to jack a car and drive around in it.<br\/> <br\/> A major complaint I have with GTA IV is that it is too easy. I guess this is to cater for the huge market which GTA IV appeals to as casual gamers will make up a larger percentage of sales than hardcore gamers. Nonetheless, it is too easy. There were only about half a dozen missions which I did not complete first time round. Of these 6, the reason for failure was often because I made a silly mistake, such as shooting a friendly character and having to restart \u2013 not because the enemies were too tough and killed me. I also managed to go through the entire story without getting 6 stars. This was a feat I was not even trying to achieve, it just turned out that way because the game is so easy. In fact, even in the later missions, it is rare that getting more than 3 stars would be scripted as part of the mission.<br\/> <br\/> Another issue I've had with the GTA series which has not been rectified in GTA IV, is the issue of money. You get awarded tonnes of money fro doing missions, yet there is nothing to spend it on. Granted, weapons cost more this time round, but you are still awarded with more money than you can do anything with. For me, it would be better if you were paid less \u2013 that way it would not be easy for you to just go out and buy the biggest rocket launcher in the game. You might further consider if it was not worth the risk of killing a cop or stealing a cop car to acquire a handgun or shotgun.<br\/> <br\/> Ultimately, despite it's flaws, GTA is a great game. It is difficult to fault it on any given aspect of its gameplay. The characters are spot on and display many more human properties than past characters have done. Niko is, in my opinion, the best lead character for a GTA game to date.  really does feel alive, with any number of possibilities available to happen during a days play. The story is engaging in a way not usually seen in video games, even if the ending does not live up to the rest of the story. On top of the single player package, you also get a decent multiplayer component thrown in for your money as well. Given all this, it is difficult to make any recommendation other than to get this game ASAP if you have a system to play it on. <br\/> <br\/> Graphics: 9\/10<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some textures look a little bland upon close inspection, and there are at times a few graphical glitches, but overall, all of the visuals come together nicely, resulting in a game that looks ace. You really wouldn\u2019t notice much wrong with the graphics, unless you were looking for it.<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br\/> Gameplay: 10\/10<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Driving is fun, shooting actually works in a first for the series. The targeting system works a dream. There\u2019s never a shortage of things to do, and they\u2019re all enjoyable.<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br\/> Sound: 9\/10<br\/> The guns and cars all sound distinct in their own ways. The music on the radio is varied, but arguably not as ear catching as previous GTA soundtracks. Talk radio is as funny as ever. Voice acting is top notch.<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lifespan: 10\/10<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The story can easily be replayed with as much fun as the first time, due to your ability to make decisions in the story and multiple endings etc. Plus, the game is too good to only be played once. Oh, and all the stunt jumps, side missions, pigeons to shoot\u2026<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br\/> Story: 9\/10<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Best story yet in GTA. It really feels like an interactive movie in many ways, helped largely by memorable characters. Ending lacked the twist I was expecting and looking forward to though.<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br\/> Overall: 9.2\/10<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">If you haven't heard of this phenomenal game by now surely you must have been living under a rock. With high marks across the board, this is the evolution of music rhythm games. This defines the very genre itself and pushes the bounds of what was once thought of as far as one could go. Taking the stale, been-there-done-that feeling of other competitors attempt at music rhythm games and completely blowing them apart, Rock Band is the definitive rock star experience. This title not only puts you in the role of an up and coming rocker, it puts you there with an entire band! Packed with songs, features, and functionality, this may not be a game for every single person, but it is a must play by all.<br\/><br\/>Sure one could argue that the game is not graphically glamorous, at least not when you compare it to the clarity of the competition, but looks aren't everything. Harmonix has pulled out all the stops to bring the most authentic looking \"live concert\" look. Complete with stage dives and crowd join-ins, even special camera attention by the band members, you really feel like you are watching a movie of a concert. The game presents in a more loose feeling as to emphasize the rock experience as apposed to every member mainly just standing still in the same place the entire time. This is especially noticeable in the singer who jumps around on stage and just has a good ol' time. With all the members really showing their enthusiasm in the current song, it is easy to see how this game surpasses what has been the norm for the past years. The variety of characters doesn't hurt either. Instead of having to look at the same three-and-a-half members the entire time, you get a mixture of different people from the games customized character system. It may not be as detailed as you would want, but it is nice to be able to choose what your character looks like, however limited it may be.<br\/><br\/>The music of Rock Band is another step up. With the way the game works, no longer must you have guitar solo-centric songs. Instead, Rock Band is free to find songs that not only challenge the guitar players, but the drum players and the vocalists as well. Heck I am sure there is even a challenging bass line in there once or twice. The 45 songs that make up the core set list feature a nice blend of genres and eras stretching from the early days of rock right up to the present. Though some songs may only appeal to a niche group, they are all fun to play. Even if you aren't particularly eager to play a certain song, you might find that playing it on drums instead of guitar makes it a lot more bearable and perhaps even fun. There are another 13 bonus songs that are offered for you to play in the bonus venue for free. This includes faithful Harmonix bands such as Freezepop, Bang Camaro, and Honest Bob. <br\/><br\/>Along with a well-rounded set list that comes packed on the game, Harmonix has raised the bar on the download side as well. Bringing something new just about every week, they have strived to make this game last through its open ended DLC side. Along with promising full albums to be available, they have worked on at least a dozen songs that are available through the PS Network. Along with the download content side, the online functionality is what you would expect by now including a face off and pro face off mode. These are accented by a band quick play mode where you pick a song and three people can jump in and play it over the internet. These are solid modes and there is no real lag to speak of. It is however discouraging that the games most prominent mode, Band World Tour, is not offered as an online mode. <br\/><br\/>Band World Tour is where this title really shines. It recreates the aspect of being the leader of a real band. You and a friend or three form a band and begin a journey to the top. As Bon Scott once said though, \"It's a long way to the top, if you wanna rock and roll.\" This is the case here as well, for you start as a no nothing band playing little tiny hole-in-the-wall venues to a crowd of 50 or so. You play songs or sets of songs and gain fans and stars in the process. The more fans and stars you gain the more venues and songs open up to you along with other opportunities such as obtaining a tour bus or a record contract. Sure you end up playing the same songs A LOT but its fun as crap to play. Plus the whole coming together experience that you have when you and your friends are rocking out really is priceless. Luckily there are plenty of fresh DLC to add into your set lists to keep things somewhat fresh. <br\/><br\/>Cut free from the tidings of Activision and Red Octane, Harmonix seems to know exactly what they want and they prove that they can hold their own as a game developer. Aside from the sheer magnitude of the peripheral failures, mine included, this game really has few drawbacks. Sure you could argue for more songs on the disc but that is just picking at air. The game offers exactly what it intends to offer, the complete rock band experience. Since the day it was announced people have been eager to see this baby in action. After seeing it, it is clear who the winner is in the battle of rhythm games and it is also clear that this game has raised the bar for the genre. You would have to be pretty incredible to top what Harmonix has laid frame for. With all that this game does, it deserves the 10 out of 10 from me. It may not be perfect, but my 10 rating isn't for that. A 10 game for me is something \"revolutionary\" and it is clear that that is exactly what Rock Band is. Paving the way for a greater gaming experience and bringing it one step closer to the \"real as real can get!\" Keep rockin'!<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a010 out of 10 (5 out of 5) &gt; Revolutionary<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "deck": "Indigo Prophecy: A True \"Cinematic Game\"",
      "description": "<p>Indigo Prophecy is a game that not all gamers can agree upon is a definitively good game. It defies the convention set by most other games before it. It's not an action game of any sort. It isn't an RPG with spiky-haired people. Nor is it anything else that can be classified under typical gaming standards. Instead, Indigo Prophecy serves its contents as a game for the gamers who prefer being compelled over being addicted by providing numerous unorthodox things that combine to be a unique package that hasn't ever been conceived nor will ever likely be conceived again soon.<br\/> <br\/> The game is essentially like an interactive movie where one can affect the various nuances of the plot on a level that is exponentially greater than what most games allow. It starts off this trend by placing you in the shoes of Lucas Kane, a man who has committed a murder that he feels was against his own willpower. As it happened to take place in a restaurant's restroom, Lucas is not alone when his actions have taken place. As the body lies before him, he needs to figure out what to do quickly so he can leave the vicinity and thusly begin his journey of contemplation.<br\/> <br\/> It's at this point where the game puts Lucas' fate in the player's hands. The restroom and its inhabitants have business to take care of, and it's up to the player to determine how it's conducted. Many choices present themselves already at this point in the game. The game provides some ideas about what to do to get past this point in the plot, but leaves the rest up to the gamer. If they choose, they can leave the crime scene early, taking care of only the essentials to allow for a quick getaway and not seem too obvious around other people. Or, they could decide to put a little more effort into covering up the evidence, making it harder for Lucas to be tracked down by investigators. What one chooses to do at many points like this in the game can have effects on how future events play out, even ones in a very immediate future.<br\/> <br\/> One doesn't just control Lucas Kane over the course of Indigo Prophecy's story, though. They'll also be playing as other characters, mainly those on the other side of the spectrum from Lucas: the investigators. Two people, Tyler and Carla, are tasked with figuring out the killer at the restaurant and their motive. They do so in the typical ways one would expect from investigators, from searching for clues to interviewing witnesses to even creating a mug shot (with your help). How good of a job they do, like with Lucas, is up to you. You could choose to have them pick up every hint of Lucas at every chance. Or, you could let them overlook a few things and see what turns the investigations take from there. Their competency is up to you.<br\/> <br\/> The whole time you're controlling the main characters in the game, you're doing so in a rather unusual way. The control scheme in this game isn't overly convoluted, like in many others. Instead, they usually rely on the two analogue sticks and the two shoulder buttons. That's it. Just four parts on the controller do everything you need to do. It may sound odd at first, but it really does work. While the left analog stick is used to move the characters around (albeit rather sluggishly, no thanks to the camera), the right analogue stick is used for doing all of the characters' actions. (The camera is controlled with the left and right trigger buttons, although the right analog stick can also be used for viewing things at odd angles.) If they're pushing a door open, one will do so by pushing upward on the right analog stick. If they're trying to climb something, the player will mimic the way the arms move by having the analog stick swing to the side and over to climb the object. All of these actions, among many others, are mapped to the right analog stick in an effort to make things somewhat intuitive, which is enhanced when the game asks the player to take their time doing these actions, ensuring that it is the course they want to take. If one does the action too quickly, the game will think the player has decided against doing the action. But if they take the time to do it at a more proper pace, then the character will obey and the action will be done.<br\/> <br\/> But the right analog stick isn't just used for actions. It's also used during the numerous conversations that are to be had in the game. During the times when a main character is talking to someone else, various responses will show up with a time limit. It's up to the player to choose what to say for the next part of the talk. The decision is once again made with the right analog stick by tilting it in the way the response indicates. The choices in such situations can range from things such as what mood to take on for the next response to what question one feels needs the most attention next. The plot may not be overly affected by many (not all) of these choices other than what happens immediately after the choice is made. However, subtleties do lie in the game that can come as a result of the things that happened during the talk, which can be interesting to pick up if you remember such things.<br\/> <br\/> There's a little bit more to the gameply after considering these things, but not too much. In fact, there's really only two more notable facets to the gameplay in Indigo Prophecy that should be noted. One that shows up involves the analog sticks yet again, prompting you to move both of them during specific sequences in the game. The times these show up can be as dramatic as some of the games action sequences to as modest as a line of questions from police. Failing to move the analog sticks the way the game tells you can have major consequences, sometimes death. However, that likely won't happen often, as these sequences are easy enough to tackle, even at a faster rate, thanks to the fact that the game conveys these commands in a non-obtrusive way on the screen. (This also allows one to get a good view of what's happening while one is participating in it.)<br\/> <br\/> The other major facet of Indigo Prophecy's gameplay involves the left and right trigger buttons. At times, Lucas (or another character) will have to exert some major physical energy to get these things done. Usually, this involves heaving something heavy, but other physically demanding times use this facet as well. During those times, the player has to button mash the trigger buttons to keep the character working hard to accomplish the task at hand. While this is an interesting way to get the player to feel some endurance that the character may be having, this can be tiring on the fingers during a few times that do this, as there is at least one time where it is truly excessive when this part of the gameplay shows up. But nevertheless, it's still yet another way that the game is successfully compelling during the course of its story.<br\/> <br\/> There's also a \u201csanity meter\u201d that shows up during the gameplay. It functions like a health meter would in other games, where if it bottoms out, the character dies. However, this meter takes on mental, not physical, health for this meter. Thus, the way the meter is influenced is by the reactions the characters have to certain events. If a character gets into an argument with someone, then it can lessen. But if something good happens, then the meter will raise. Beyond the dying thing, though, this meter has virtually no influence on the game. No matter what mental state a character may be in, they'll still act the same way. This is rather odd, as one would expect that perhaps the dialog would change with one's mental state. But instead, the characters just always act the same no matter what. Even if they're depressed, they won't show it unless the plot automatically calls for it.<br\/> <br\/> The entire ride, though, is a rather short one. The game can be completed within six to eight hours. For some, that may or may not justify the price tag that may have been paid for the game. But the plot of the game (even if it does indeed go freaky towards the end of the game) makes it well worth it. As such, since the game is so short, it's recommended that, if one has the time to do so, to just go and play the game in one sitting. It is indeed very much like a movie in that regard, where interrupting the plot before it's over can degrade the experience a tad. It's not meant to be put on hold for long, as Indigo Prophecy is presented in a way that is just meant to be experienced from start to finish, even the amount of time it takes is essentially as long as watching an extended edition of one of Peter Jackson's \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movies twice.<br\/> <br\/> The presentation of the rest of the game beyond its plot is somewhat modest. The visuals are certainly not eye candy in any way at all. The models for all of the characters are decent, as are their motion-captured animation. But everything in the game in the game that there is to see is on par with what one would expect a game's graphics to be at minimum these days (although by no means are the game's graphics bad).<br\/> <br\/> The sounds of the game are kind of there, per se. Some things, like footsteps, are really hard to pick up, which can deceive one into thinking that Quantic Dream just didn't put the effort into making the sound in the first place. But the other sounds come out just fine, with everything else sounding the way it should when the sound pops up.<br\/> <br\/> All of the characters in the game do speak, however. The voice actors do an O.K. Job at projecting the lines they're given. They give the characters emotion when the time calls for it and they do make the characters seem believable enough (even if the corresponding lip-syncing is usually bad). However, even if the game is meant to be like an interactive movie, the voice acting doesn't quite reach the quality of movies themselves. It seems as though the game tries to do its best in that regard, but was only able to do so with B-list quality voices.<br\/> <br\/> The music in the game is a hit-or-miss at most times. While many of the classical music pieces that show up in the game do a superb job at helping create the mood of the game, other pieces of music usually do a less-than-stellar job. The game licenses music from several artists, but usually does little with them over the course of the main game. One can listen to them during times where a character has free time, but the music isn't that good enough to really justify listening to multiple. The only real low point in the music is most likely when one has to listen to Tyler's bizarre funk theme song, which just appears to be out of place every time it comes up and just sounds bad overall.<br\/> <br\/> Indigo Prophecy is certainly not a game for all gamers. It has a pacing that many are unaccustomed to, as well as a story to back up that pacing. There are also a few things that can be griped about in general about the game, which could turn some people away. However, the experience to be had with the game, despite a few hindrances, may well be worth it, even if it is for only a short time. But during that time, those who are open enough will discover a unique game with experiences that aren't to be found anywhere else. Truly, this game is an obscure gem in all ways.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Hmm, Condemned 2. Where do I begin? Why not some good. The first game was one of the best launch titles for the 360, and probably the only one worth buying. It had its share of scares, combat, and grossness. How does the new one stand up to it? Well, you don't have to worry about them being the exact same game. This one is way different from the first one, actually adding a lot of new content. First off, definitely the combat. The attacks feel good and fluid, and generally the hit detection is spot on. Multiplayer may be different, but its probably just the lag. The sound is incredible, and everything sounds amazing. The gunfire is generic, but not that bad. Graphics are modest, but they are really good for making you scared. Such as lighting and gloom effects are spot on. Oh yeah. This game is SCARY. Maybe not to some, but for others, it will make you want to play with all the lights on, and maybe a person watching you. The atmosphere is great, the lighting is great, the sound is great, and all that will come to together and scare the crap out of you. Now the bad. The multi-player. No I'm not saying its bad. No I'm not saying its good either. Its pretty much generic. I cant say I like the deathmatch and team deathmatch, simply because everyone will eventually gather into a huge ball of fist throwing and kill stealing. But bum rush and especially crime scene are loads of fun, and will give you something to do for a few days. Now the actual bad. VOICE ACTING! The voice acting is all modest, except some people its terrible. Did the newscaster know she was voice ACTING? Her voice annoyed me, simply cause it sounded like they got her off the street to read lines. Also whats bad, the screen will get really blurry during the hallucination scenes, and a lot of the levels seemed put there since they were a good idea the developers had. The story is okay, but it really becomes stupid at the later levels. And now on to the new stuff. Combos and the investigations. The combos are tough to pull off, but are pretty cool, and the investigations are cool, but they get pretty tough. Finding out whats arterial splatter and random splatter is tough, simply cause I what the heck some of the answers are. But overall, the games a great horror game, and a pretty good edition to any Xbox 360 or PS3 owner.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Army of Two is one reminds me of one of those B-rated action movies. You have Rios, a battle-hardened soldier who looks like he's seen enough death in his lifetime, and Salem, a young spunky kid who's every other word is \"bro\" They start off in the army and figure out that mercenaries make a shit-load more money and apparently get to choose their own missions. This of course leads to them joining a PMC (Private Military Corporation) where they get to wear masks and pimp out their guns. \u00a0This of course leads to more B-movie material where you would have to be brain dead to not see a major plot point coming up.<\/p><div><br\/><\/div><div>Speaking of brain-dead, that is essentially what your computer-controlled partner is. He'll shoot enemies and take cover, but only if you\u00a0explicitly\u00a0tell him to. This is fine, until later levels when bullets are hailing down on you and you have to keep checking whether or not your partner has enough health to keep shooting or if he needs to take cover. Another annoying aspect about the Ai is when you get damaged enough you fall to the ground and have to wait for your partner to come drag you to safety and heal you. This seems a little too much for the computer to handle as you will be screaming at the screen for your partner to heal you or drag you to cover as the computer seems to know what you want it to do, but chooses to do the opposite.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>The gunplay however is pretty solid with a pretty set of customizable options available such as changing the barrels and cartridges on your gun, adding silencers, and even pimping out your gun. Yes, you heard me, you can have a pimped out .45 magnum and yes, it is just as awesome as it sounds. This of course affects a key element of Army of Two which is aggro. People who play MMORPG's probably know this, but basically if you are shooting then you build up aggro which makes the enemies shoot at you and your partner is essentially invisible. This works very well when fighting your enemies. Maybe a little too well... While your partner shoots at the enemy, you can just go to the enemies and shoot them and they won't really notice as long as your partner has the aggro.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>The game is fitted with a pretty good soundtrack of rock which is really the only genre needed to get in the mood for a game like Army of Two. The voice acting is pretty good, and the characters are likeable. The game also looks pretty good with the main character models being the eye candy. However many of the enemies look exactly the same and some of the textures in the environments can get a little bland.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>This game is also <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">incredibly <\/span>short. You will probably be able to beat this game in 5-6 hours and I never got a chance to play the multi-player since not enough people were on for me to play a match. So would recommend you rent this game if you want to try it.<\/div><div><br\/><\/div><div>This review is pretty negative I know, so why does it get 3 stars? Well the game is pretty fun. Bashing enemies with your helmet, customizing your weapons, and running through missions guns blazing is pretty fun and Army of Two does a good job of this. So I recommend if you want a fun weekend and have a friend to play with, rent Army of Two and I can say you will probably have a blast.<\/div>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">With a guy like Slash on the cover, it must be good right? Heh, say what you will about the guy, half the people like him, the other half don't. I don't suppose you could guess which camp I fall into. But joking aside, does the next iteration of Guitar Hero live up to all the hype? Well that is the question. It is Guitar Hero, as you remember it, with a plethora of songs to be shredded on the new Wireless Les Paul. A few new additions attempt to bring the growing staleness of the title to new heights, but with the sale of the series to Neversoft, you really notice where the game falls short, and that is in quite a few places.<br\/><br\/>First lets discuss the newness. This incorporates an all-new set list boasting 71 songs, 40 of which appear as the game's core gameplay in career mode. Alternately there are 6 songs exclusive to the two player co-op career mode, which is great, if you know someone who has a guitar and is willing to come over and spend some hours blazing through it. Unfortunately for those who don't have that friend are left high and dry short of cheating to get those songs. Another factor to consider is the fact that the guitar isn't even offered by itself, so even if you did want to jam with you significant other, you are SOL unless you enjoy having two copies of the game lying around. Then there are the songs themselves. Along with a terrible cover of Paranoid the tracks leave something to be desired. Aside from the 20+ bonus tracks from not very well known bands, the core songs really aren't that great. I would venture a guess to about 15 or 20 that you might really want to play, with the rest being fluff. There is more then one time when you say, \"Will this annoying song ever end?!?\" I am sure that there is a good base of people who would enjoy more then that but as for the entire group of us, I doubt it.<br\/><br\/>The co-op exclusiveness isn't the only big flaw in planning. The biggest new addition, whether you love it or hate it, and there is no gray area there, is the boss battles. Neversoft has created this new system of guitar battling which uses, of all things, power-ups to defeat your opponent. You face off against Tom Morello from the late band Rage Against the Machines, and Slash from the late Guns' n' Roses. Along with another devilish opponent, you and your foe go toe to toe in a custom song all the while trying to screw them over to the point of failure. If you don't succeed, your opponent automatically wins a draw. Now aside from the completely broken balance of this system, i.e. someone strikes first and the other is stuck trying to recover the entire time, this mode really just isn't any fun. If you were ever excited about it when it was announced, you will be disappointed. The idea, is sort of neat, but the implementation is completely lacking and gives it more of a tacked on after thought feel. <br\/><br\/>Along with the boss battle system, Sony fans get something else new to the series, multiplayer action. Now you can jam with, or against, people from all over. Just another way for people to find out that there is always someone out there who is better then they are at the game. But seriously, the online is solid and surprisingly enough has really good reliability. You don't have to worry about lag, which is key in rhythm games and the gameplay is really smooth. You can play battle, co-op, or face off, all of which work seamlessly. <br\/><br\/>With all the talk and praise of the new Les Paul controller, really the actual peripheral comes up quite short. Aside from the basic Guitar Hero feature, the only real differences are, you can remove the neck, you can change the faceplate, and its wireless. Now wireless isn't something to laugh at, everyone loves wireless guitar rocking, but the number of times that this overly glorified feature have been mentioned during production really takes away from who great it really is to be able to rock from your couch or what have you. The absolute worst part of the controller is the complete lack of backwards compatibility. Therefore, gamers, myself included, who own a backwards compatible PS3 will not be able to play the older Guitar Hero games with this controller. This to me seems like a real missed opportunity for a little extra revenue that Neversoft is so greedy for. Removing the neck is convenient for storage purposes but again, not a real winner of a feature. Changing of the faceplate is sort of lame in reality. Sony has offered skins for both their PSP and the PS2 but no one really uses that to the point where it's a great feature. If anything else, this is just another cheap way for Neversoft to squeeze more pennies out of your wallet. <br\/><br\/>All in all, you feel a lot of cheapness from this game. Certainly not from the price tag, but you definitely feel it in the overall experience. Along with shameless plugs for Axe Body Spray and other products, the whole presentation feels a little cheap, especially for a \"current gen\" game. The graphics are not as played up as they should be. The sound is a bit quirky and will cut out on you at times. Really the number of songs should be higher as well. With a Blue Ray disc, you have so much room for storage and there hasn't been a game yet, this one included, that really gives you that sense that you get all the bang for your buck. With lofty ambitions set by the user base, Guitar Hero III really falls short and with their obvious money centric presentation, this title really isn't all its cracked up to be. If you are looking for the same old Guitar Hero experience however, then look no further, because flawed though the game may be, it is the same Guitar Hero style that you know and love and even though it doesn't pull its weight to bring it to the big rankings, it does get the 6 out of 10 rating from me which puts it at the solid level of a \"Fun\" playing experience.<br\/><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Unicode MS'\"><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>My name is Adam and I'm a turn-based combat-aholic. My other confession? Lost Odyssey is my first Japanese RPG and I can say without a doubt that it won't be my last. Almost every moment of this game is a beautiful and moving experience. An experience stretched over 4 discs and 45 hours, but one worth all that time and effort.<\/p> <p>This was never a game I thought I'd play. With a full-time job, 13 month old son, starting up\u00a0 a new business, etc. etc. I have no right to set aside forty hours of my life to just one game, but I'm so glad I did. Once that first disc goes in and the cinematics kick off, you fall under it's spell and enter a fantastical magical world.<\/p> <br\/>Playing as Kaim, an immortal wiped of his memories, you start in the midst of an epic battle, interrupted by a deadly meteor impact. From there you begin a journey to reclaim your memories and investigate Grand Staff - the centre of a new and potentially unstable magic energy plant.<br\/><br\/> <p>The journey of the game is all about the characters as opposed to the plot. Kaim is a brooding and dour hero with little show of positive emotions and a far too serious nature - something that would be disastrous on its own but is countered by a tremendous ensemble cast. The most notable is Jansen, a wise-cracking, womanising mortal who balances out the seriousness of the immortals and also adds a touch of realism to the characters.<\/p> <p>It's within the group that the real story lies. The plot of main game is cliched and follows an obvious path, but acts only as a carrier for the gripping development and self-discovery of the characters.<\/p> <p>This self-discovery is told in conventional cut-scene form and also in the form of 'dreams', small fragments of the immortals memories that surface as your progress through the game. These dreams are essentially short stories shown on screen in text form. Wait! Text? On a screen? Boring surely?<\/p> <p>Well no. The whole manner of their presentation is a tribute to the game's art design. The text of these memories are revealed slowly and sometimes dynamically as you read with still, sometimes hand drawn, images fading in and out at appropriate moments. This, coupled with a truly melting and melodic soundtrack provides some of the most moving moments of the game. On several occasions I was reduced to tears whilst reading. Not the 'I've-got-somehting-in-my-eye' tears but full on baby-weeping, inconsolable, the world is ending tears.<\/p> <p>It's these moments, followed by a heart-wrenching scene about Kaim's daughter and grandchildren, that make the first disc a complete sob-fest and genuinely moving you to care deeply about the characters you play.<\/p> <p>This leads on to a minor gripe that the story never really reaches those dramatic heights again - not to say it isn't compelling from that moment on, but the rest of the game merely fades back into being excellent rather than life-changeling so.<\/p> <p>The other problem is the translation of the stories. Some are fine but many others suffer from an odd word or turn of phrase that doesn't quite fit in with the epic scope of the theme. This might partly be due to the American localisation as well as translating the text from the original Japanese. But still, it's a minor gripe and doesn't detract too much from the experience. I found that the english language audio was also waaaaay too American for my tastes and turning it back to the Japanese with subtitles made the experience richer by far.<\/p> <p>In terms of gameplay we have a very traditional turn-based combat system which, dammit, I like a lot. Although the pre-battle muscle flexing can get tiring after a while, as does the random battles - something that surely should be a thing of the past by now?<\/p> <p>Aside from those minor quibbles Lost Odyssey is a tremendous work of art and regardless of any time constraints you may have is worth devoting as much of your life to it as possible. In 45 hours of gameplay I only got frustrated once - and that was facing the final boss. For the record I managed to beat the game with most characters on level 49-50, not particularly high for a game like this.<\/p> <p>A word also about the soundtrack. Beautiful. It has a perfect blend of delicate instrumental tracks and migraine-inducing techno-splurge. The music for the final boss is just an epic orgasm of rock guitar and a double choir - something that should be downloadable for Rock Band surely?<\/p> <p><u><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/u><\/p> <p>The maker of Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima, was recently quoted saying that he wanted his game to make people change the way they look at the world or feel about certain issues. I'm not sure if he succeeded in his game but Mistwalker certainly has with theirs.\u00a0 I came away from parts of this story feeling more alive and more drained of emotion than any film or book in recent memory - it's not preachy or blatent in any message or moral issue, it's just an excellent blend of storytelling and gameplay with memorable characters and a fantastical world.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">So when I first picked up this game I didn't really know what to expect, I know the game was a supposedly going to be more single player focussed but being a battle field game I was more excited for the multiplayer.<br\/><br\/>First thing you will notice about the game is a great visuals, the game looks really nice with great explosions and a huge draw distance but that said there were only two things that bugged me about them, the first being the filter put over\u00a0the picture. Sure\u00a0is makes the game feel a little more\u00a0gritty but overall just detracts for the all-round visual look of the game, leaving the game to look grainy. The second thing which\u00a0bugged me was the \"destructible\" environments. Sure it is only a new thing to be done, well at least\u00a0in the way that\u00a0it was done in this game.\u00a0On the\u00a0whole it was fine but sometimes it\u00a0didn\u2019t work as good as other times. Some buildings don't blow up apart naturally, because the way they blow up is very geometrical, so if you shoot a rocket at one wall it will leave a square hole which you can walk straight through but the you can walk around to the other side of the same building and shoot a grenade launcher at the wall (which is the same type as the previous wall) and then it will leave the same shape hole as the one of the other side. I am sure there are a lot of reasons why the developers chose this route but to me it sometimes felt a little clunky. But that said the games visuals are still great and suit the games style.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">The game play in bad company is what you come to expect with a console FPS these days with a few unique changes. Instead of taking the \u2018hide behind cover to regain health\u2019 system the developer stuck with the numerical health system but what makes it unique is that instead of finding health packs you have a needle\/epee-pen which you can jab yourself with to regain you health to 100% unless you are playing multiplayer when only a the medic can do it but is also able to supply med kits which slowly build up your health as long as you are close enough to one. Another thing that makes the game a little more unique is just the size of the levels. They are absolutely massive in both single and multi player and this helps add to the game with the large use of vehicles which let you move across these larges maps with ease. One weird thing about the vehicles is the control for them, even though it doesn\u2019t get in the way its just takes a while to get used to. <\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Then there is the games single player. I found it interesting but it\u2019s still not up to par with other First Person Shooters out on the market. The story has its moments but all round isn\u2019t very solid with a predictable ending and few plot twists. The story only seems to be there to tie together the missions and set a scene and nothing much else. Although It\u2019s not a bad story, A couple of the characters are fun to watch and have a lot of personality with the help of some good voice acting but the characters themselves aren\u2019t enough to turn the story into a great one. It finished with a bit of a predictable finale but you don\u2019t fell disappointed. So even though the single player feels like a set of missions strung to gather with a mediocre story it\u2019s still enjoyable.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Then there is the multiplayer, this is the true star of the show. It has a full ranking system with upgrades and a ton of huge maps to play on. The only bad thing is that there is only one game mode to play. The hole point of the game is a attack and defend sort of thing. One team must defend the gold creates while the other team has to attack and push the other team back until all gold creates are destroyed. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">\u00a0<\/span>It\u2019s a fun game mode and I am yet to get tired of it but if you are expecting a COD4 experience you might be disappointed. <\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">So all together it\u2019s a nice package, with an OK single player and a fun multiplayer all with detectable environments and good visuals it\u2019s defiantly worth a look. I think as long as you don\u2019t go in with huge expectations you won\u2019t be disappointed. <\/span><\/p>",

Well Infinity Ward is right there with you. Feeling that their popular World War II franchise is turning a bit stale, they thought they might take a new approach to that oh so tired out series. Ripped straight from the day's headlines, Call of Duty 4: Modern warfare puts you right in the thick of battle as it is today, not as it was 60 some odd years ago. It is arguably the best representation of a modern day war zone that you can play on a console today. The game has dramatic lighting for a truly realistic feel. The audios and visuals poured through this title are awe-inspiring and make you hard pressed to think of a game that delivers them better. Rolled up with excellent gameplay mechanics and implementation, Call of Duty 4 puts you as close as you can possibly get, or want to get, to the real action.<br\/><br\/>The dev. team has really gone all out with this one. They have poured detail into this game much as you pour water in a glass. And you know how you can fill it so high that it has a little rounded look at the top? Well that is how you can think of level of attention given to detail they have put into this game. That is they used as much of the power available to support little things that they could without overflowing and making a mess of things. The ability that they have shown in being able to harness the raw power available in the PS3 hardware is first of its kind and hopefully a trend setting as well. You will notice everything from the dialogue during combat from your squad mates to the ricochet of bullets off of your cover, to the casting of shadow though out open levels, there truly is no better first person shooter for this console then this one. <br\/><br\/>So what about the game itself? Aside from boasting a nice multiplayer package, it does have a single player campaign that delivers a satisfaction unparalleled all be it a short one. The combat spins off of two main characters, the first being a British soldier by the codename Soap. Under the lead of Captain Price, you make your way through the equivalent of a tutorial level to teach you the ropes before being thrown right into some shady business upon a boat. After a bit of action as Soap, you then take the role of Jackson, one of America's finest from the USMC. As you would expect, you see many a combat zone with this guy including many times when you find yourself being shot at from all directions. Even though the story here is shorter then most, it does deliver on a level that surpasses any in the genre. It is no cakewalk either. A lot of times you will find yourself pushing upon a dug in enemy to get to some point before some timer runs out. These timed parts can be extremely frustrating. Throw in an unreliable checkpoint restart mechanic and you've got yourself a recipe for throwing controllers, if you are so inclined to do so. At any rate you can't help but feel like you accomplished something when finally do finish the campaign.<br\/><br\/>Any way you slice it, this is one intense experience. Whether it's storming through a TV broadcasting station, crawling through tall grass between enemy troops, or jumping across a collapsing bridge, this action packed game will fulfill its promise to deliver modern warfare to you and even though the campaign is short, it is still fun and full of great times worth playing through again, perhaps in arcade mode where you are rewarded with points for your efforts. The only snag in the otherwise solid gameplay is the failure of the game to recognize checkpoints, sometimes you have to start a few checkpoints back from where you should have started, of course if you don't die you won't have to worry about that. All in all the game is good and delivers an experience that is \"Above and Beyond\" what is expected, making it a 9 on my ten point scale. So what are you waiting for? Go get yourself a copy!<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Welcome to Silent Hill.<br\/> Or welcome back to Silent Hill if this is not your first SH game.<br\/> For me it's not, I've played through all the 4 (now 5) titles of this wonderful franchise (my favorite actually) and intend to replay them for as long as I live. I'm what you could call a SH-maniac.<br\/> <br\/> So, does SH0 disappoint or not?<br\/> <br\/> No. It does not. Let's divide this review into different categories:<br\/> <br\/> <b>01 - STORY<\/b><br\/> The story is very good and very reminiscent of SH2 (because of the emotional part), but not going into many details (I don't want to spoil it to you) it goes like this: Travis Grady is a trucker, driving into his next destiny\/job. On the way he decides to go past Silent Hill for a shortcut but something happens, a little girl crosses his way (sounds familiar?) and he stops and there's nothing out there. In the reflexion of his side-mirror he sees the little girl again and follows the road to a house on fire. After saving the little girl, Travis faints and wakes up in a misterious foggy place, a street, clouded by fog. Silent Hill. He decides to check out the hospital and see how's the little girl doing. But something is not right... || 9\/10<br\/> <br\/> <b>02 - CONTROLS<\/b><br\/> The controls are very responsive and the animations of movement are very fluid. There's a slight wait of like 1 second after you press SQUARE for Travis to run. But this is probablyon purpose because, let's face it, if it was real you would also waste a second to start your full run. So this adds to the credibility of the game and the difficulty. Also, Travis gets tired (wich was missing from the other SH's), thankfully there are energy drinks scattered around town for you to keep running (specially in town when the straightjackets are all running towards you!). So this is something else that adds to both reality and difficulty of the game. Also, thank God for the shortcut for the weapons (by pressing the directional buttons) a la Silent Hill 4 wich is awesome if your weapon breaks or you waste all your bullets 'cause you don't need to open the menu and navigate through all the menus to get where you want or use and medicinal pack or drink. You use the analogic to move around, CROSS to check\/pick up objects and use doors etc; TRIANGLE to access your map (very useful as usual); and CIRCLE to toggle your flashlight on\/off (remember this is very useful to hide from monsters and sneak past them!). You also use R1 to go to your fight pose\/aim and CROSS (while R1 is pressed) to attack\/shoot. So the controls are easy to learn and easy to get, no difficulty here and very good response. || 10\/10.<br\/> <br\/> <b>03 - GRAPHICS<\/b><br\/> The graphics are some of the best you'll see on PSP, and the static effects (when you get close to monsters) are very similar to when Henry was close to ghosts on Silent Hill 4. Very cool. The screen flashes red on the sides to warn you when your health is very low, so keep an eye on this. The sceneries are totally awesome specially on the \"other-world\" where they become gruesome and blood splattered. The monsters are very well modeled\/animated and very very gruesome\/disgusting. I love the \"plastic\" effect they have too. The character models could have more details on them, but nothing that will get in your way. I had a very funny experience with this, while I was fighting a monster the camera was right between Travis and a Wall and Travis leans backwards to attack the monster and the camera goes inside Travis' head LOL it was the scariest thing I've ever seen. Back to being serious, everything on this category was great. || 9\/10<br\/> <br\/> 04 - ATMOSPHERE<br\/> So, we know this looks like Silent Hill by now, but does it FEEL like Silent Hill? Hell yeah it does! The fog is there, the radio is there, the flashlight is there, the monsters are the there. The town is there. Along with some familiar characters (one of wich was really BAD on this game =\\). Apart from this character, we'll be visiting some familiar spots and majorly new ones (yay!). Also, the music Akira Yamaoka makes (wich is perfect!) and the sound effects he produced (wich are also top notch) make a huge difference on the atmosphere (more macabre and frightning). || 10\/10<br\/> <br\/> <b>05 - SOUND AND MUSIC<\/b><br\/> As I said in the previous category, Akira Yamaoka's music\/sound is perfect (as usual) and fits the whole game\/ambience\/story so well that will make you cry... in fear. :) GO AKIRA!! || 10\/10<br\/> <br\/> <b>06 - REPLAY?!<\/b><br\/> This game is scary and excelent for the first time. But on the times to follow you probably won't be as scared (if scared at all). The game is missing some \"WTF?!\" moments that we were used to see on other Silent Hills, but this does not mean you won't like replaying it and you won't have anything to aim for. You do, and lots of stuff. This game presents a new mechanic called ACCOLADES, each time you do something specific you will unlock costumes or weapons (or other cool stuff). Also there's loads of spots you can check out in town that you won't be visiting the first time because you'll be too worried running away from the freaking jogging straightjackets! And now, here's the major downside to the game. It's SO - FREAKING - SHORT! I finished it in 4 hours the first time, and in 1 HOUR the second time (the UFO ending is indeed like 40 min before the true end of the game, but even so you will probably finish the whole thing with 1 hour and 30\/40 minutes the second\/thirt\/etc time you go through it). This does not mean it's not fun and you will want to play it again and again either for the adrenaline of killing monsters and stuff or to see the 3 different endings (you will want to see them, specially the BAD ENDING, wich is the true ending to the game) and getting all the accolades. So yeah, there's a lot of stuff to do here. Aside from the accolades system you will get the EXTRA OPTIONS (the ones you see in all the other SHs) only after you finish it once (it has some new options there too). <br\/> <br\/> So, is this your first time on Silent Hill? I'd suggest you play the other ones first as you will understand the plot a LOT better. But, if you are already playing this before playing the other ones, keep going, because on the good side, you will want to play the other games to get the whole (well not whole) thing straight. Could be a better prequel as it does not tell you much of the beginning of the story (or even Alessa's father) but it's entertaining to play just for Travis' story. It does get some of Alessa's background straigh thought, wich is good, and explains what really happened before Slent Hill 1 (it's a direct prequel). Now I want a prequel to the prequel. Lol.<br\/> <br\/> So if you're a Silent Hill or Survival Horror fan and own a PSP this is a MUST PLAY! Excelent game with great quality. Climax really did it! Of course Akira Yamaoka (GOD) had clearly his finger on it (you can see by the previous version of the game).<br\/> <b><br\/> OVERALL || 9.5 (5 Stars)<\/b><br\/> <br\/> Excelent game! \t\t<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Grand Theft Auto the three little words that spark controversy with parents and politicians and is also the game that sparks excitement in the hearts of gamers. Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest players in the video game industry selling millions of copies and has a place in pop culture. Grand Theft Auto IV is one the most anticipated video games of all time and not only has it delivered on the hype it has surpassed it, making Grand Theft Auto IV one of the greatest games ever made. But what makes Grand Theft Auto IV so special? Very simply put the attention to detail. Rockstar Games have done a phenomenal job in making Liberty City a living breathing world. When it rains citizens take out umbrellas and those that don't have one use there newspaper , when you kill somebody that is riding a car they fall on the steering wheel and the horn sounds off, while sprinting if you run into someone they'll get knocked down and drop there coffee. What adds more weight to this detail is the graphics; Grand Theft Auto IV is easily one of the best looking games this console generation. Adding more to this the incredible soundtrack that's fits game so well, no matter what you're into you'll find a radio station for you, and probably the best thing about this game is the rich characters Rockstar games are known for each of them is unique. The best thing about Grand Theft Auto IV is the gameplay, Rockstar Games have done a great job in remaking the aiming system and have also implemented a cover system which works really well. The controls might take time to getting use to but once mastered you well have a blast. The missions in Grand Theft Auto IV are varied and exciting and do provide a challenge. Grand Theft Auto IV main story quest will last around 30 hours plus and on top of that there are plenty of side missions which adds to the replay value. Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the greatest games ever made and gamers all around need to play this.<\/p>",

      "deck": "BLACK and boom",
      "description": "<p><span class=\"yui-non\">BLACK was on many a wish list for quite some time before launch, and in many respects lived up to they hype.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">However, there is very rarely perfection in a game, and BLACK has its share of flaws that detract from the awesome graphics and initially intense gameplay.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">Playing the role of a Black-Ops agent, your mission is to hunt down and eliminate the leader of a shadowy terrorist organisation called Seventh Wave. In the somewhat limited story, Seventh wave are international in their scope but strangely restrictive on their recruitment policy - only hiring Russian-speaking mercenaries to do their work. There is also intrigue as you discover that the reason for your enforced debriefing - shown as cutscenes between each mission that actually takes place after the events in the game - is not as clear cut as you think.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">The action in BLACK takes place in a number of locations across a fictional Eastern European city, from abandoned, war-torn city streets to fields and abandoned farmhouses, from an abandoned asylum to a prison. Which is also abandoned. Surprisingly. In many ways, BLACK is a powerhouse of a game. It promises Hollywood-style action, and by God, does it do that in spades. The first time you play, you will be blown away (no pun intended) by the simple act of launching a rocket into an office building or church tower, only to watch all the windows on one floor blow out. (or in the case of the church, the tower collapse completely). And although the grenade-throwing mechanic feels a little clunky, you will marvel at the explosions that ensue. And don't even get me started on intense shoot-outs in tiled communal bathrooms - stuff flying everywhere!<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">And this, in one way, is BLACK's strongest feature - it manages to squeeze just about every iota of processing power out of the old Xbox, producing a game that, being honest, looked next-gen before there was a next gen. In fact, it actually puts some next-gen games to utter shame. The Treneska Border crossing level, for example, is set in woodland, and the fact that grass is rendered here a la Call of Duty 3 is a marvel. Lighting and fogging effects add to the stunning imagery, and all in all, you are left wishing that, somehow, game developers had managed to figure all this out a lot earlier in the lifecycle of the beloved console. To watch an RPG round head towards its target, leaving a plume of smoke in its wake, is a joy. Sound is also very well done, with much whizzing of bullets, ricochets and environmental sounds. Some of the weapons sound a little lifeless, admittedly, but they are LOUD. The enemy chatter is intriguing at first, all in (what sounds like) Russian, although the variation is limited, and gets a bit repetitive after a while.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">The in-game music is excellent for the most part, with a stirring main title theme in which Michael Guacharo\u2019s presence is obvious. He will be sadly missed from the Medal of Honor franchise!<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">Overall, gameplay is good, with some flaws, but the promise of non-stop action is maintained, at least for a while. But the mechanic is flawed in that there is no variation - it is TOO non-stop. After a little while, you realise that the only thing really keeping you glued is the visual aspect of the game, and even that starts to wear thin after a while. And this, sadly, is where BLACK falls down. Which brings me to the first flaw in this game - overall the story is a little weak and it is difficult to fully engage in the character you play, or his motives. And there are conflicts in the scale of the story - we are led to believe that this is a terrorist organisation you are tasked to destroy, yet, everywhere is destroyed and abandoned. How big is Seventh Wave? Some of the settings look like the Third Reich has steamed its way through, laying waste to everything in its path. There are no local armed forces, just the bad guys, you, and occasionally a couple of teammates to keep you company. These are admittedly niggles only, and there are great games out there with little or no plot at all - yet they are still great. But it is still noticeable. For example, in a game such as Serious Sam, you don't really lament the lack of a story - it doesn't really need one. You shoot alien dudes. But with BLACK, once you start getting into plotlines and exposition, you really feel there should be more to it. And there isn't. Which is a shame, because there cold have been great potential for a Tom Clancy-esque plot here. Once you realise you don't really care why you are doing what you are doing, the interest peters out.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">Another sticking point is the enemy AI, or lack thereof. Enemy combatant types are not very varied - five in total - and the tactics they employ are: 1 -walk around before you do anything. 2 - once they spot you, shoot at you from wherever they are or run out in the open through your line of fire to get to cover and then shoot at you. 3- when behind over, walk into the open, shoot a bit, go back. Rinse and repeat. The first part of tactic two can make for some intense close up action in places, but sadly the second part of it and third tactic mean that long distance combat is a simple case of lining up your aim for the head the first few times they pop out, pop back, pop out, pop back. It doesn't take long before this starts to feel like an assembly line. Thankfully you will never be short of ammunition - it's lying around in spades - but like other aspects of the game, holding an enemy in place with bullets till he drops get a bit old.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">It also takes a lot of bullets to take down enemies. And I mean a lot. This is partly explained away by everyone wearing body armor. But it takes something away from the gameplay when you are pumping ten or more shots into a dude before he goes down. And that's just the basic grunt-dudes. Some level of graduation between the basic character classes would have been nice, and also a little more location-specific damage. Some hardcore tension can arise when fighting shotgun dudes, as they take hella damage before keeling over, and can take you out in one or two shots. But after a while of playing the game, you realise that they are totally unable to cope with a circle-strafe maneuver, which takes the edge away.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">You can cause damage to the game world - trees fall apart, columns shatter, tiled walls are reduced to bare plaster. But whilst this is awesome at first, it doesn\u2019t take long to spot where the damage is built in - visible seam lines in trees, convenient explosive barrels in key locations. It all becomes a bit formulaic.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">Difficulty is also a bit fractured. On the easiest setting, the challenge is fine until the Asylum level, where the difficulty is suddenly ramped up to something altogether harder. Then the following levels go back to easy, and then the final level again sees a turning up of the difficulty slider. A more gradual toughening would have been better placed here. I can see many less-experienced FPS fans being put off by the sudden change on the Asylum level. And the checkpoint system and lack of player saves does not help matters much here.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">Lastly, there is no co-op or multiplayer component at all. Perhaps these would have been a little too much to ask, given the demands placed on the console by the single-player campaign on its own. But it is still a shame. So, in conclusion, BLACK is very good game on first play-through, clocking in at between 8-10 hours. But once you know enemy locations, and where there is stuff you can blow up, replay becomes a mindless exercise. It can still be fun every now and then, but you will find yourself playing only the levels you enjoy the most, and then not very often. Some replay value is added by the harder difficulty levels, where extra mission objectives are added. Completing the game means that you unlock silver weapons with unlimited ammo for any for that difficulty level and any below it. Even that is flawed - you can't turn them off, so if you finish easy difficulty and want to play again without unlimited ammo, for a challenge, you can't.<\/span><\/p> <p><span class=\"yui-non\">This is definitely a show-off game, but I wouldn't buy it new - if it is even still available new nowadays - search out a pre-owned copy, or rent it first. There is fun to be had, but it is to be hoped that the upcoming Xbox 360 version (or second and third sequels, as some rumors state) pick up on the flaws and work to improve them. True next-gen visuals and the removal of the niggles that take this game down a peg or two could make for a truly awesome, replayable and unforgettable experience.<br\/><\/span><\/p>",

Brawl was the game I bought a Wii for, and it has not let me down, there is a great roster of characters, and some of the new additions are truly great (here's looking at you Pit and Meta Knight!) and fun to play, the characters animations are definitely top notch, a big improvement on melee.<br\/><br\/>The sound is great, with a seemingly endless amount of game music, all very nostalgic. The loading times are massive compared to what I expected, and along with the gimped random online features these are the only problems I have with the game.<br\/><br\/>I could not bear to give it less than 5 stars, the Subspace Emissary single player campaign is excellent, and very long, although it does feel fleshed out, and there are a good lot of interesting and fun evens to try also. Controls are sharp and responsive, although you will want a Nunchuk with your Wiimote for best results.<br\/><br\/>If you own a Wii you need this game.<br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>First of lets say I'm a fan of the Devil May Cry series but this game really shouldn't carry the name.<br\/> <br\/> Dante's disk took me on the first play through less than 4 hours which i just flew through and not in one sitting as the repetitive gameplay becomes mind numbly boring.<br\/> There is no real story to follow you got through area running and killing demons that\u2019s it.. But DMC has never been known for its story<br\/> <br\/> Gameplay: Its up to the player how to tackle each level if you really wanted to you could just run from A to B fighting the bare minimum of enemies as the levels are allot wider than DMC1 and there isn't really the need to fight them. Only a few areas have locked doors than can be opened only when all enemies in the area are defeated. The gameplay is this hack, slash, shoot, maybe dodge depends how fast you are on the trigger and run to the next level... that\u2019s pretty much it<br\/> The enemies feel dumbed down nowhere near as hard or vicious as those in DMC1 most will stand still as you run towards them slashing at there fellow demons.<br\/> Bosses add some challenge but even then its the same old just slash shoot and jump there\u2019s no strategy needed or skill just have to be reasonably good at button bashing.<br\/> <br\/> Graphics: Keeping in mind the game did come out over 3 years ago the graphics are very bland textures look blurry and the enemy character models for some could be copied and pasted but with different colors.<br\/> The frame rate is always steady though no matter how many characters are on screen and the areas are quite large.<br\/> <br\/> Sound: Devil May Cry is quite well known for its soundtracks which in this game is one of the few things it has in common with the others. It mixes metal goth and an eerily castlevania style music together with great results as absurd as it may seem.<br\/> Where the sound falls short however is the voice acting.. It\u2019s just terrible the dialog is poorly written and delivered worse Lucia's accent is enough to wish that games didn\u2019t hire voice actors and Dante himself has lost all charm and has become a bland shell of his former self.<br\/> <br\/> Value: Now you could probably find this game going extremely cheap on the used market or even brand new but you really shouldn\u2019t bother its not fun and has no replay value you'll put together a max of maybe 8 hours playing through both discs but you'll wish you hadn\u2019t as there roughly the same with some slight changed between Dante and Lucias missions.<br\/> <br\/> Overall Devil May Cry 2 isn't fit to hold the Devil May Cry name and truly is a disgrace to the series, try your best to avoid it.<br\/> Try not to buy it your money could be put towards a more deserving game<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Savage 2 - A Tortured Soul is an incredibly unique and ambitious game that has broken many boundaries of the conventional multiplayer game. Developed by the independent studio S2 Games it allowed them to create a truly unique experience that was not restricted by the larger companies who are unwilling to go out of the conventional lines.<br\/> <br\/> Savage 2 pits players against each other each playing as two vastly different teams, the Humans and Beasts. Rather than being a simple reskin of the other army such as in a Battlefield game, the two sides have very distinct differences and play quite differently. For example, the beast side has a Summoner class which utilises pets to attack foes, whereas the Humans have no such class.<br\/> <br\/> The game is similar to the Battlefield franchise as players are given the objective of taking control of the map, but rather than victory points, RTS elements are brought in. One player from each time plays as the 'Commander' who plays out the entire game from an RTS camera view. He builds base defences such as Arrow Towers, Mines to extract gold and further your team's economy, tech buildings to allow players access to more powerful abilities and classes and the amazing Hell Shrine to allow his team access to the powerful Hellbourne units.<br\/> <br\/> Whilst all this is going on, the other players on the team are in a fiece fight to take control around mines and give their commander enough time to get a mine and defences going to ensure they keep control of that portion of the map. The action takes place in Third or First person perspective and is extremely fast paced. Melee combat is balanced in a rock, paper, scissors style and forces players to think rather than simply point and click. Guns, bows and magical staves are fired from the first person and take all the skill of a conventional shooter to use.<br\/> <br\/> As well as offensive classes, the game features healers from either side to support their attacking teammates and keep them from dying. Some of the most spectacular parts of the game are the dramatic siege weapons being unleashed upon the enemy buildings. Players can take control of catapults and battering rams as well as giant tree-wielding troll-like creatures to deal devastating damage to enemy buildings. These weapons are perfectly scaled and the vision of the towering 'Behemoth' wielding its tree trunk is truly epic.<br\/> <br\/> The game promotes team play and strategy, with players having to think on their feet and co-ordinate attacks as well as relying on inherent player skill to take down enemy players.<br\/> <br\/> All in all Savage 2 is a terrific game which should not be missed. It's only downfalls are a lack of players and a few minor bugs, but no more prevelant than in a mainstream title. The free demo account is well worth a look as this is a unique game which really must be experienced to fully understand the breadth of action it has to offer.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>After a extremely long wait, almost a decade, Team Fortess 2 was released and it was totally worth the wait.<br\/>Team Fortess 2 is a class based multiplayer online shooter. This is one of the best online shooters I have played, it is fast paced and easy to learn from but difficult to master while being great fun.<br\/><br\/>The game possess an art style which is similar to the one used in the Pixar film 'The Incredibles' but take note, it is not for kids. Gore and gibbing are the manner of the day but the violence is cartoony. The game is not also a system hog as you would expect it to be due to the fact it runs off the Source engine which powers the Half-Life 2 game and its' expansions.<br\/><br\/>The sounds within the game is also top-notch. The characters voice-overs bring an overall sillness which is sorely needed in multiplayer games today. The weapons sounds are perfect and never distract from gameplay. Watch out for the hilarious announcer on the Goldrush stage. Though there is a occasional annoying sound bug.<br\/>Hopefully valve will patch this.<br\/><br\/>Team Fortess sports a simple control scheme which are in many First Person Shooters today and doesn't require a steep learning curve. Players will need to know about each class particular nuance such as the rocket jump for the Soldier and stickie jump the Demoman. These are easily learned by the seeing other players use the techniques.<br\/><br\/>Now the gameplay, which is outstanding to say the least. There are a total 9 classes within the game. They are subdivided into offensive, defensive and support categories. Most are well balanced and enjoyable to play.<br\/>You can have fun as a Soldier instantly gibbing people, have fun perfecting the art of camping by playing Engineer, mow down people with heavy, snipe people (which will make them hate you) as a Sniper. This fun applies to the other classes too.<br\/><br\/>The maps also provide a lot of fun too, my favourite is dustbowl which sports a attack\/defend style where the attacking side has to capture contol points and defending side has to, well, defend these points. Team Fortess also has Capture-the-Flag and control point capture. The game has plenty of maps with additonal maps being released by Valve through downloadable content.<br\/><br\/>To get the most fun out it make sure you work with a team e.g a medic healing a heavy to make a unstoppable force with the medic using his healing gun which can make teammates immune to damage. There are many combinations to make. The game has a fantastic online community with quality severs out there.<br\/><br\/>With Valve continuing to release further content by way of new maps, new weapons tied to achievements and patches which increase balance, as well as the game making full use of the Steam Friends functionality, Team Fortess will be around for a very long time.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>\u00a0<br\/><br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>The devil may cry franchise is one of big players in video game industry due to part of fast pace hack and slash gameplay. The original Devil May Cry came out in 2001 and is often held as one of the best action adventure game ever made, but the series has been though many up and downs; thankfully Devil May Cry 4 manages to deliver a great experience and is one of the best in the series. The biggest problem with the Devil May Cry franchise is the difficulty, capcom never seem to have gotten right DMC2 was way to easy while DMC3 was way too hard so much so that capcom had to re-released it. But capcom really did its homework with DMC4, for starters there are two difficulties to choose from in the beginning Human (easy) and Devil Hunter (Normal), the human difficulty is obviously targeted towards newcomers while Devil Hunter is for veterans, furthermore there is a tutorial in the first level of the game which teach new comers the basics of the Devil May Cry 4 combat system. Veterans of the series will quickly notice the new protagonist Nero he seems like a character that was made to carter newcomers as his moves aren't as deep or complex as Dante's. In Nero's arsenal are his Blue Rose a Duel Barrel Revolver \"Dirty Harry eat your heart out\", the Red Queen a large sword with a motorcycle handle which allows players to charge there sword for faster and stronger attacks or exceed which is what the game calls it and finally the Devil Bringer a demonic arm that allows Nero to do busters which means he picks up enemy's and slams them into the floor and he even says \"Slam-dunk\" and the second ability allows Nero to stretch out his arm to reach certain platforms or even grab enemies a'la Bionic Commando style. Half way though the game you well get to play as Dante and this is where Devil May Cry 4 gets really fun as Dante plays more fluid than Nero. Dante gameplay mechanics is very similar to DMC3 except for one big change and that is that he can now switch Styles on the fly which really opens up the combo system and allows for a lot of crazy things to happen. Dante four styles are the same as DMC3 you get Trickster, Swordmaster, Gunslinger, and Royal Guard you get pretty much the idea by there name. Graphically Devil May Cry 4 looks amazing, character animation and models look superb and the level design is diverse. On the sound department Devil May Cry 4 retains its heavy metal soundtrack and it's probably the best one in the series. Devil May Cry 4 length will average around 7 hours to complete but you can go back to find secrets and carry over your powered character into the many difficulties in the game, adding to the replay value is achievements and online leaderboards this adds a lot to the game as you can compare scores with your friends online. Devil May Cry 4 is one of this years best action\/adventure game and if you have either a PS3 or 360 and are in the market for an action\/adventure game this is it.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>For those of you who have never heard of MOO2, it is a game where you play the emperor of a space empire that starts small and you have to build it and defend your worlds, and become the greatest empire in the galaxy. However unlike some games, it\u2019s not needlessly complicated. It all starts with the race selection screen where you can choose to do what you like, pick a race based on your play style\u2026or create your own race (a feature I much prefer).<\/p> <p>Hidden under the visual facade of the 16 bit graphics is a really well built ecosystem\/economic system. The AI battles with each other, sometimes your blamed for the actions of other races in a very under the table spies and cloak and dagger kind of way.<\/p> <p>It\u2019s turn-based, each turn is about 10 years, allowing enough time for you to justify a planet being able to develop without it seeming a little daft.<\/p> <p>The graphics are beautiful in their design, compared to todays standards they\u2019re rubbish, but really well drawn and your scientists move in a two frame animation, which I always find quite funny.<\/p> <p>The thing that makes this game great is game play, for a space-strat-sim it\u2019s got something for everyone:<\/p> <p>Science, a very deep research tree with benefits that actually have an impact when you get them. You can beat the game using science and your mind instead of brute force.<\/p> <p>Terraforming, Genetic manipulation, Chemical weapons, Mass-destruction or BFGs that would make doom pee itself.<\/p> <p>The micromanaging of planets is fantastic, certain buildings will give you bonuses and certain races will have innate benefits you can take advantage of. You divvy out your possible working masses on each planet in to three piles:<\/p> <p>1: Farmers<br\/> 2: Workers<br\/> 3 Scientists<\/p> <p>A simple system that really makes it easy to get on with running the galaxy at large.<\/p> <p>Building, buildings that benefit your people anything from theatres to hospitals can be built and most of them have upgrades; every little helps. You are able to customize ships, the way they look, what the fire power is even what kind of soldiers are onboard.<\/p> <p>The ship builder is detailed, fun and easy to use, build the kind of ship you want, make \u2018Deathstars\u2019 that can destroy an entire planet, (but be warned destroying entire planets can really piss of those bugeyed ETs) All ships have there place in the game, with the Deathstars (correctly equipped) being the be all and end all.<\/p> <p>Fight, blow planets up (really cool animation for this), attack ships, take over planets and enslave the people, bombard planets and start afresh with your own people. Genocide is, at least in MOO2, kind of cool.<\/p> <p>The fight system is based on a grid in a 2D plane, the space version is really fun to use, cool animations, little missile that takes a few turns to reach your target it\u2019s all about tactics and tactics are rewarded (which is always nice) . There is a \u2018calculate battle\u2019 button, which when your going through the universe taking over each system, ironically systematically, is really useful. The planetside version of this I will get to in a minute.<\/p> <p>Peace is an option, you could always just make peace with everyone and become head of the council, thus winning. I really like that this was an option truly a open-minded game indeed. Really at odds with when it was made.<\/p> <p>This game still has a great online community, even to this day. It\u2019s great fun if you have a home LAN network; even if you don\u2019t there is a hot seating mode. One computer can equal loads of fun.<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>It is really hard to say what I <em>DON\u2019T<\/em> like about MOO2 because I love it so much.<\/p> <p>But, nothing is perfect (except maybe me). Most of the time your in for the long haul, and sometimes the AI creates a cascade of events which means that you are alone against an intergalactic superpower. Which as you can probably imagine is really annoying.<\/p> <p>The planetside battles are really badly designed, it\u2019s nothing like the space combat and you have no control over the battles. It\u2019s all automated and often you watch your simple townsfolk in there own 16bit world, with there little poking sticks; getting beaten from afar by aliens in suits with big guns. This is really frustrating, especially when your spaceships are far out powering theirs. Who cares who can benchpress more, when you have a gun that can blow up a planet?<\/p> <p>The diplomatic relations AI is a bit rubbish. And stupid.  Ask it something enough and you\u2019ll find it\u2019ll do one of two things:<\/p> <p>1. Do what you ask.<br\/> 2. Declare War.<\/p> <p>Now when all you\u2019ve been asking is for sub-terrainian farm technology you start to ask yourself \u2018<strong>why?<\/strong>\u2018. Which is almost unforgivable until your beating them to death with there own flux-capacitor and they are begging for peace and offering up there own mother to placate you.<\/p> <p>This is however a really nice moment.<\/p> <p>One thing that really really got on my nerves was the Antares, aliens from another dimension that would randomly attack random systems and decimate the planet and then fly back to their own home world (going to there dimension and killing them is a way of beating the game -not an easy feat I can tell you), if they happen to be attacking a system your just developing and it\u2019s not protected by your entire fleet you might as well give that planet up because it\u2019s back to the drawing board. This is a really annoying game mechanic that punishes those you don\u2019t get the fast engine tech early. Which is mean because I think that food is more important on developing worlds because rocket fuel doesn\u2019t feed babies.

      "description": "<p>Bizarre Creations have come up with yet another graphical showcase on Microsoft\u2019s console. Hours and hours of footage and hundreds of pictures made it possible for them to create photo-realistic vehicles and environments. The game features 80 licensed supercars and the environments span over Tokyo, New York, London, Las Vegas and N\u00fcrburgring. The soundtrack features songs from genres like Hip Hop, J-Pop and even Classical. There\u2019s the online play you could find in PGR 2 and even an online career. The off-line Career includes 23 different championships, with many of the modes you\u2019ve come to know from previous PGR titles. Cone Challenge, Overtake, Speed Camera and new modes like Breakthrough (timed checkpoint races, similar to Tollbooth races in Need For Speed Most Wanted), Drift Challenge (earn enough Kudos by drifting in a very limited amount of time) and Time VS Kudos (racking up Kudos stops the timer) challenge your racing style, how well you handle oversteering and so on.<br\/> <br\/> However, when comparing these numbers to that of PGR 2, you\u2019ll find these numbers are far from an improvement. They\u2019re actually a step back from the 100+ vehicles, 100+ tracks and huge off-line career found in PGR 2. The soundtrack is also significantly shorter than the 200 songs found in PGR 2 and there are no radio stations.<br\/> <br\/> Then what makes this game worthwhile, you ask. Well, it\u2019s that this game oozes of quality, and it does feel like you are driving these supercars in real life. 80 cars seem like a small amount, but every car is high-end, and in the beginning you get to choose between cars like Ultima GTR (my pick) and Chevrolet Corvette C6. There are also some impressive concept cars, and car enthusiasts will be positively surprised to see cars like Nissan GTR Proto, Ford Mustang GT-R and the Ferrari F430. <br\/> <br\/> There\u2019s also the new cockpit camera. In this view, you\u2019ll se your motion-captured hands work the steering wheel and gear, and (if you\u2019re using a car where you can see this) you\u2019re feet working the brakes and throttle. It\u2019s all really realistic, and you\u2019ll see any buttons or screens you would see if you were driving the cars. There are also realistic shadows and you\u2019ll see the dirt or any damage on the front window. You can use the right thumbstick to look around in the cockpit and look in the mirrors, as the regular rearview mirror is removed in this view. The mirrors are realistic too, but the draw distance is much lower. The camera shakes and you\u2019ll see how the G-forces affect your view, which makes it very intense at times. Some of the tracks are bumpy and fast, and in cooperation with the cockpit camera makes for a great sense of realism. If only there were any steering wheels available for the Xbox 360 yet\u2026<br\/> <br\/> The sense of realism is greater enhanced with the authentic engine sounds. You\u2019ll definitely hear the difference between a Ferrari F50 GT and a Shelby GT500, and the sounds change according to which camera you\u2019re using.<br\/> <br\/> The cars also handle different. Not necessarily realistic (you\u2019re brakes don\u2019t lock up, for instance), but it definitely feels as it.<br\/> <br\/> Your cars get damaged and scraped, but not necessarily realistically\u2026 The damage is only cosmetic, though.<br\/> <br\/> The online play is also good. There\u2019s very little lag, except for some rare occasions where your opponent will disappear and re-appear or bounce a little. There\u2019s a great chance of hurting your rep, as other gamers will mistake competitiveness for anger, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not the game\u2019s fault. There\u2019s a cool Gotham TV, where you can see the best of the best or your friends in action, just like if you were watching a replay of yourself. The online career is pretty much like a set series of sessions, and is a good place to make cash and Kudos. It is pretty short, though, and it would be nice with more events based on the lesser classes. It will probably be updated though, and the same goes for new content like cars and tracks. The car classes includes D, C, B and A. A is the highest-end, with cars like McLaren F1 LM, and D is the lowest, with cars like Ferrari 355 GTS.<br\/> <br\/> As you make money you can buy cars. I know, pretty obvious... However, there\u2019s no system that limits you from buying the best cars early in the career. You never win new cars to buy or own, except for 10 of them who are unlocked by reaching Ranks by getting enough Kudos. If you keep your starter car, which is definitely possible as the game seem to change your opponents according to your own car, and rack up 1 200 000 Credits you can buy ANY car available. The problem is, almost all of them are available, even top cars like Lamborghini Muci\u00e9lago R-GT and McLaren F1 LM.<br\/> <br\/> When buying your car, you can choose to view cars from a specific manufacturer, cars priced under 100 000, cars in the 100 000 \u2013 200 000 price range, cars priced over 200 000 or cars that you can afford. After your selection, a list of cars will show up. By using the triggers you can sort by name, price or performance. When browsing the list of cars, you\u2019ll see stats like Horsepowers, Torque, Top Speed and Drivetrain as well as meters displaying Drifting, Top Speed, Acceleration, Braking and Grip. You\u2019ll also see Gotham Sport Comments next to the car. The comments describe how well it drives, how easy it is on the player and some facts regarding its history. This can be helpful because when the game sort cars after performance, they don\u2019t put into consideration how easy the cars are on the player, like oversteering and overpowering. When you buy a vehicle, you have to choose one color for it; the color cannot be changed without buying the same vehicle again. As you get more cars you\u2019ll also get new garages. These are all photo-realistic, and a nice feature lets you walk around your garage and see how the sunlight hits your car. This really shows off what a graphical wonder it is, and how it\u2019s more than you would expect from a launch title. You can also move cars around garages if you like sorting your cars, or move specific cars in or out of the sunlight. There's also two arcade machines in every garage, one with Geometry Wars (from PGR 2) and one with a trial version of Geometry Wars 2<br\/> <br\/> Another nice feature is the new Photo Mode. Photo Mode lets you take your own screenshots when watching a replay, viewing your garage(s) or in a race. In Photo Mode you can walk around and really take a closer look at objects and environments. By doing this I\u2019ve found hidden pictures of what I believe are the guys that made the game, seen old cabs parked between buildings and more. The cheering crowds and some of the objects aren\u2019t that graphically impressive when up close, but you won\u2019t notice it when doing turns at 150 MPH, especially not with the game\u2019s gorgeous motion blurring.<br\/> <br\/> Yet another new feature is the Route Creator. There you can make your own checkpoints and do as the title says: create routes. The Creator is limited though, and the walls made by the Creator are harder to see and often badly positioned.<br\/> <br\/> There\u2019s a series of badges you can earn in the game, as well as Xbox 360 Achievements. The Xbox 360 Achievements includes reaching Rank 5, Rank 1, owning every Lamborghini in the game, owning every Ferrari in the game and completing the off-line Career mode in Steel, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The Badges includes having a car collection worth 1 million, earning your first Platinum medal and buying every car in the game. There seems to be a problem with the \u201cOwn Every Car\u201d Badge, as I own every car, but I haven\u2019t gotten it. I\u2019ve checked for missing cars or duplicate cars several times, but I truly have every car. It would be nice with an option to only show cars you don\u2019t own, as spending money on a car and then finding out you already owned one is a real pain in the you-know-what\u2026.<br\/> <br\/> The latest in the PGR series yet again show off impressive graphics, but it does fall short on length. The Medal system (Steel, Bronze, Silver, etc) helps give the game replay value, and you rarely use the same track more than once. The authenticity shines through, and makes you want to experience the intense racing over and over again. It\u2019s also every car enthusiast\u2019s dream, thanks to many concepts cars that\u2019s never been in any game before. Racing fans have to be crazy to sit this one out!<\/p>",

      "deck": "Grand Theft Auto IV Review",
      "description": "<p>Gameplay: 9\/10<br\/><br\/><br\/>GTA IV's gameplay is basically much the same as previous GTA games. You can run around an open world jacking cars and killing randoms. But like previous GTA games there are also street races and many other mini games. There may not be as many mini games as they had in GTA San Andreas but there a lot smoother now and they actually have a purpose. The game also brings life to old a stale features and adds an extra realistic detail which makes it feel like your playing GTA 3 for the first time again.<br\/><br\/>The driving in GTA games has always been fun. Whether it's the sliding around corners or really getting that sense of speed, it was always just plain fun and only sometimes annoying. But with GTA IV comes a real learning curve. The car physics have been redone making the car control seem more real and more fake at the same time, it's a good balance. You'll still slide around corners like a madman but if you drive that way you'll end up smashing into the sides of a lot of buildings. You also won't feel the same sense of speed that you're used to even when you're a sports car like the Infernus. But those are just small annoyances when you consider how fun it can be learning to drive with the new car physics, at first it's hard but you'll soon realise that you have to break on every corner and then it will feel natural. Anyway, if you don't like the new driving you can always catch one of the many taxis roaming the streets of Liberty City. Which is one of GTA IV's new features and trust me your going to want to catch a taxi sooner or later, the ease of just hailing a taxi, holding the Y button to jump in and then letting the taxi driver do all the work for you. Or you may prefer to skip the trip all together for a little extra cost, but I do highly recommend listening to the hilarious dialogue of the taxi drivers. A little feature Rockstar also added was that you can no longer just open a parked car and drive away you'll now have to watch a short animation of Niko breaking the windscreen and hotwiring the car before you can drive away.<br\/><br\/>The aiming systems in previous games have been highly criticized for being clunky and very simplistic. Each game has slightly improved on the lasts aiming system but this isn't the case with GTA IV. The aiming system has gone under a complete over-haul which was much needed. You can still choose to lock-on or free aim at your target but you'll want to lock-on to your target because of being able to choose which part of the body you want to shoot at. This feature adds a lot of strategy to shoot-outs; with a flick of the analog stick you can take aim at an opponents head for an instant kill. Or if you're getting attacked by an enemy on a ledge you can take a shot at his legs making him fall to his death. Another feature that increases strategy in shoot-outs is the new cover system. Just like Gears of War if you don't take cover you will die... quickly. It was a smart move to add cover to GTA. In the old games shoot-outs were very unrealistic because you could run into a room full of twenty plus enemies and come out with barely a dent in your health meter. Alas the cover system has some flaws, like the old aiming system it is very clunky. The only real complaint one can have about the shooting in GTA IV is the extreme lack of guns. In total there are only 15 different weapons to have in your arsenal and the more destructive ones like the Rocket Launcher can be really pricey.<br\/><br\/>Friendships were subtly introduced in GTA San Andreas in the form of Girlfriends. In GTA IV they are a vital part of the game. Most friends you will meet during the games main storyline but you can also meet some male and female friends over the internet dating site love-meet.com. Each relationship will have its own benefit, whether it be a taxi service or dial-a-bomb they all add something new to the gameplay giving you an incentive to go out with them. To make your friends like you more you can call them or they can call you to arrange a game of bowling, darts, pool or even a little bit of drinking. The drinking will especially have some fun implications. You may also like to see a show with them, you could watch the cabaret or go to a comedy club and listen to well known comedians Ricky Gervais and Kat Williams.<br\/><br\/>The internet makes its debut in GTA IV in the form of internet cafes called tw@t (which we're actually in GTA 3 just not accessible). The internet offers over 100 pages of content which is all in its own way hilarious. Whether you're looking for dates, a new car or even hacking into the police database there will always be something for you to do on the internet. You can also receive e-mails form family members back in Russia giving a little bit of back story to Niko before he came to Liberty City. Some side missions can also be received via e-mail.<br\/><br\/>The side missions are much the same as they have always been. You have street races, vigilante missions, taxi jobs, deliveries, stunt jumping and hidden package collecting. And the addition of most wanted missions which along with vigilante missions are accessed through the use of a police computer. You may be thinking but wait, there was more in old GTA's and yes you are correct. There are no ambulance and fire truck missions. Which isn't a big loss as they where boring.<br\/><br\/>GTA IV has fewer mini games than GTA San Andreas. Which like the side missions is not a big deal. The mini games that they have left in are now just better and actually have a purpose. The mini games include pool, darts, bowling, Cubed and drunk driving. The drunk driving is extremely fun to do because it actually makes you feel like your walking around the streets tumbling off the curb and driving a car into lamp posts. After a while you can sometimes find yourself feeling a little dizzy just from watching the blurry screen swirl around. Pool is nearly an exact replica of the San Andreas version and darts is just too easy. Cubed is an interesting take on tetris which if you play too much you may just become addicted to it. The worst mini game of the lot would have to be bowling. The pin physics are horrible. What would be a perfect strike in real life would result in maybe five or six pins falling down. It's completely random if you get a strike or not. This is easily the worst mini game GTA has seen.<br\/><br\/>GTA IV's gameplay delivers everything you would expect from a GTA game. Stealing cars, shooting people and roaming around a city and doing what you like when you like. Which is a lot more than any normal person would need. It is only slightly let down by a few things that could have done with a bit of polishing like the cover system and bowling mini game. It's missing a few things from old GTA games that were never that great so it's really no big loss.<br\/><br\/><br\/>STORY: 10\/10<br\/><br\/><br\/>Past GTA games have had stories that were never quite 'there'. For example GTA San Andreas had a long story, longer than GTA IV, but 60% of the game was irrelevant to the story. Where GTA IV's story (which is about 90 missions long) is constant the whole way through.<br\/><br\/>The main reason GTA IV's story succeeds is the main character. This time around you fill the shoes of a Russian immigrant who is just arriving in Liberty City because his cousin lied to him about living the 'American Dream' with many women. But as the story progresses you'll learn that he is also trying to escape from his past. To quote him, he's killed people, smuggled people and sold people. His name is Nikolai 'Niko' Bellic and he is the most three dimensional character the series has ever seen. Unlike the old characters he's not a yes-man. Instead of doing everything he's told like a good boy he questions his employers motives and makes them give him a reason to do there dirty deeds. Hell at some points in the game you're given the opportunity to spare your targets life for your own benefits. It's moments like these you realise that Niko Bellic is no ordinary video game character. Oh, and lets not forget, Niko is a cold-blooded badass with no morals.Now you try tell me he isn't appealing to you.<br\/><br\/>The secondary characters in the game are varied and interesting. You have your comedic characters that you love, and the tough mob bosses that treat you like crap which you can't help but hate. Having these interesting characters draws you into the story of the game in new ways. You're no longer playing through the story to unlock everything you need to cause destruction, your playing through to see how the characters evolve around you.<br\/><br\/>As I briefly mentioned previously, at certain points in the game allow for you to choose what you want to do. I'm not going to go into to much depth but at certain points of the game you can choose to kill your target or go after your employer, each option will have its benefits in the long run like earning houses and bonus outfits. You may even get a different ending. This helps the player immerse themselves into the story of the game.<br\/><br\/>GTA IV's story is one of the best I've seen in a videogame. It has dynamic characters that evolve over the progress of the game. Rockstar have given us the chance to change the story by making our own choices during the game which can result in two different endings. Few games can boast a story to be better than that of GTA IV.<br\/><br\/><br\/>SOUND: 10\/10<br\/><br\/><br\/>Sound has always been one of the GTA series strong points. There amazing dialogue, diverse radio stations and the sounds of the city are top-notch, and this GTA IV is no different.<br\/><br\/>The dialogue in GTA IV has been called Oscar worthy. That may be a slight exaggeration but without a doubt the dialogue is excellent. Rockstar has done things a little bit differently this time around, instead of hiring big Hollywood stars like Samuel .L. Jackson and James Woods to do voice over work they've essentially hired a bunch of nobodies. This helps make the game more realistic because you're not relating characters to there voice actors. You have no choice but to let the character tell you who they are, giving more depth to the characters and story.<br\/><br\/>The radio stations in GTA games have always been diverse and besides a few exceptions, hilarious. Like always there are talk stations, hip hop and rap stations, funk stations and rock stations. But what makes GTA's stations special is that even stations with the same genre of music have a unique flavor. The music of GTA IV consists of licensed music from names like The Smashing Pumpkins, Queen, Kanye West and there's pretty much a whole radio station dedicated to the legendary Bob Marley. GTA IV's soundtrack also consists of music written specifically for the game that fits seamlessly with the feel of the game. Rockstar has also bought back the fan favorite radio DJ Lazlow.<br\/><br\/>\"Get moving you jack***!\" \"Get out of my way you **** face!\". Ahhhhh the serenading words of your fellow Libertonians... yeh not quite. While your walking through the streets you'll be treated to sounds of pedestrians conversations, engines failing, metal clashing against metal, an inconsiderate ped drive by with his radio booming and occasionally a gun shot or a ear shattering explosion. These improved sounds really makes it feel like your there during that gun fight or when your speeding down the 'Booth Tunnel' at a 100 mph.<br\/><br\/>The sounds of GTA IV are extraordinary. The dialogue is movie-like; the radio stations are as good as ever, and you can really tell the difference between firing a pistol or firing a shot gun. Everything just sounds, right. It's things like these that make GTA IV what it is.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>GRAPHICS: 10\/10<br\/><br\/><br\/>The first thing you will notice about GTA IV is the graphics, they are technically outstanding. They may not be the most photo realistic graphics you've ever seen but if you take into account the sheer size of the redesigned Liberty City and how much is always going on you should realise that GTA IV's graphics are a technical masterpiece.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>Even when your just taking a stroll through the streets of Liberty City you'll notice how much effort Rockstar North has put into getting the animations right this time around. The animations in previous games were at best sub-par. GTA IV ends the tradition of clunky animations through the use of the Euphoria game engine. Niko's motions are now fluent and well choreographed, adding to overall realism. For example if Niko were to turn left while running his body will tilt left. The sharper he turns the more he tilts.<br\/><br\/>It's clear that Rockstar has also worked on improving pedestrian looks and behaviours. You will rarely see two pedestrians which are identical, contrary to previous GTA games where in area with 10 pedestrians in it 3 of them would look exactly the same. The peds actions have also been improved, instead of walking around aimlessly they will read the paper, tie their shoes and even enter and exit buildings on their own accord. The improvements to the peds really helps sink in the fact that Liberty City is now a living, breathing world not just a bunch of pixels shaped into a city.<br\/><br\/>Like all games in the open world genre the frame rate isn't perfect which is understandable considering the game's size. But what makes this game better than the rest is its frame rate issues are minor and barely noticeable. In 3 hours of straight game play I only noticed it play up twice, compared to the GTA games of old where you would see a car pop-in every two minutes.<br\/><br\/>Although GTA IV's graphics aren't the most photo realistic we've ever seen they are truly astonishing to look at. You could spend a whole session of playing just walking the streets being amazed by how Rockstar succeeded in creating a living, breathing city.<br\/><br\/><br\/>VALUE: 5\/5<br\/><br\/><br\/>Do I think GTA IV is worth buying? Yes. I was asked about a week ago if I would buy GTA IV if they were selling it for $300. My answer was yes. GTA IV is jam packed with content which will keep me busy for months. And that's not even starting to think about the DLC that they will be bringing out. If you buy one game this year make it this one. You could call it game of the year, or you could call it the game of the decade. But what it should be called is the best game ever, period. For every bad thing in GTA IV there are 50 good things. This game is so full of content that 80% of people will never experience it all. It may be a while before you see a game that tops this one.<br\/><br\/><br\/>TILT: 5\/5<br\/><br\/><br\/>Grand Theft Auto IV in one word...... Revolutionary<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><\/p>",

      "deck": "Sam Fisher is back for the fourth time",
      "description": "<p>Ubisoft's fourth entry in the Splinter Cell franchise proves that there's still life in the old guy. The Splinter Cell franchise remains robust and satisfying, but some changes have been made for the worse.<br\/> <br\/> As you begin playing you'll notice three options. These are introduced by the voice of a woman, which is a first in the series. Special Features is nothing special (Credits and the E3 Trailer for Rainbow Six Vegas), but the other two, Single Player and Multiplayer, are definitely noteworthy.<br\/> <br\/> The Singleplayer menu is presented with good old green. It's basically just different shades of green, some fancy character animations and environment fly-bys that works as pointers to what you can expect later in the game. The thing I noticed first was the option called TRAINING. I hopped into that one first, and was greeted to an interesting video while the game was loading. It had no sound, but you saw Sam Fisher waking up in a bed behind guarded doors. This could mean many things, but it has later proven to really mean nothing. The training level seems more like a \"dream level\", so maybe he just had a dream while being tested or something. When the training begins, a female voice tells you what you need to do. The level is whiter than Michael Jackson, and everything shines with a marvelous glow. Your \"mission\" is to reach a photo of your late daughter Sarah. Some camera jamming and rappelling from a pipe later, not to mention an Achievement worth 10 points, you'll get to Part B of the Training. Here it's a little more interesting, and there'll actually be humans involved. There's a hostage situation at large, but with only three people to worry about. This is the training level after all. You'll finish this quickly, and get another 40 gamerscore points. The training level wasn't just good for the achievements though. I for one loved the clean colors!<br\/> <br\/> Training is fun and all that, but what about actually getting into some Double Agent singleplayer action???<br\/> Well, Double Agent features pretty much the same gameplay as in Chaos Theory, but (as should be expected) with some additions. The animations are very fluid, sneaking around is enjoyable, graphics are great and the AI is clever.<br\/><br\/> On the very first mission, which takes place in Iceland, you begin underwater. It's not much underwater action in this level, but another level, which takes you to a Lost Planet-like environment, features a lot more swimming underground. A new way of taking out enemies is by braking the ice underneath the enemy and pulling him under, followed by stabbing him in the chest. This is awesome, just like snapping people while hanging in a pipe was in Chaos Theory. However, there's just not enough opportunities to do this. You can do the trick maybe 3-4 times. One of the new moves introduced in Chaos Theory, the ability to jump up and pull the enemy under while shimmying, can be done maybe 4 times. The manual says that you can split jump and do the neck split while holding on a pipe, but I played through the whole singleplayer game without even having the chance of doing this. Seems as Ubisoft didn't feel the urge to show off Sam's array of moves as much as in previous Splinter Cell games. A new move I really love is the ability to attack an enemy about to bypass the wall you're leaning against. A symbol will appear, and pressing A will make Sam chop the unsuspecting enemies throat, throw the enemy into the wall and get him into a hold. The hold is the same as in Chaos Theory, where Sam press his army knife against the enemy's throat (Sam held his pistol against the enemy's head in the first two games) and holds up the enemy's right hand. If you're leaning into a wall where throwing someone into it is not suitable, like an oddly shaped or too short wall, Sam will throw his enemy on the ground, with Sam on top. This is not the beginning of a freaky sex scene, but a brand new hold. Sure, Sam can't move, but it's cool to see the enemy's neck being pushed to the limit by Sam's bicep... Sam might be 50 years old by now, but shows no signs of getting sloppy. It's also fun too look at Sam as he interrogates the enemy. As always, some of the enemies actually know something, whether it's security codes ( these can also be found in computers or simply hacked), the location of an objective or whatever reason they have to work for the bad guys. <br\/><br\/> I'm the kind of player that wants to go through the game unspotted, and without having to kill anyone. The thought of eliminating unsuspecting guards, and them living to know it, appeals to me. If you're NOT like me, you can easily go on a killing spree. This will usually get the NSA pissed off, not to mention lower the scores you get after each level, like in Chaos Theory. There are some times you're forced to kill in order to defend yourself, however. On the other hand, you have a lot of non-lethal gadgets on your disposal, like gas and stun grenades, flash wall mines and the numerous add-ons for the SC20K. SC20K is the silenced machine gun rifle Sam uses. The rifle hasn't changed much. The scope is different, with a smaller scope that only display a laser spot as crosshair. A nice touch is how the scope is away from Sam's eye, and you'll be more aware of your surroundings as you try and nail that headshot. A bigger change however, is the compatibility with different gadgets. You have the familiar Sticky Shocker (launchable tazer) and Air Ringfold Round (launchable object that knocks the target out for a couple of seconds), but also new gadgets like the Shotgun extension, several grenades, Sticky Cam (the Sticky Cam has the same functions as the old Diversion Cam, with the added function of blowing the sucker up) and more.<br\/><br\/> As you can see, Sam has a lot of gadgets. These can be unlocked by doing some of the secondary objectives. These are usually of the reach-objective-without-any-alerts.<br\/> Sam himself, however, also has a a lot of moves. You'll be climbing up pipes, going through little holes and interacting with machines.<br\/><br\/> The level designs are great as always, with several different environments. Strangely, though, the focus seems to have been shifted from darkness to more of a lit up environment. There's actually a lot less cases where you need to use any of the goggle visions. This is probably why the sound and light meters have been cut In stead, you'll only have three colored dots. Green means your in a dark environment and safe from spotting, unless you start jumping around, yellow means your lit up and might be spotted and red means you've been spotted.<br\/> Graphics-vise, Double Agent doesn't disappoint. Some of the environments are spectacular and the graphics hold the standard. However, it doesn't exceed them like the previous games did. If you liked how the rain dropped on Sam in his leather suit as he was creeping in almost complete darkness, you might get a little disappointed in Double Agent. The graphics are showed off in other ways however, very nice sun effects and realistic water. I missed the emphasis on shadows the previous game shad, though.<br\/> <br\/> Sound disappoints a little. The voicework is good, but the voices are too low compared to the rest of the game, and there's no subtitles. You'll turn up the TV, but then turn it down the minute someone starts firing a weapon. The soundtrack is nice, but not the best in the series.<br\/> <br\/> Double Agent is called Double Agent for a reason. Sam is infiltrating a terrorist group, the JBA, to stop them from destroying parts of the U.S. The terrorists are U.S., but are under the impression that the country is run by the wrong guys. This isn't really original whatsoever, but there's some interesting new features. Notably, the Trust system. As a Double Agent, you have to please both the NSA and the JBA, but sometimes the two contradicts each other. You'll have to make some important choices, but not really enough. There's maybe 5 of these choices through the entire game. At the end of the game, I had the feeling that the game wasn't as big as the previous game's, but as I started playing the game again on Hard, I liked it even more. The game isn't shorter than previous Splinter Cell games, but not really longer either. The presentation is at its best at the beginning, with some impressive CGI. The later cutscenes are not CG, but with mo-capped in-game animations.<br\/> <br\/> Multiplayer is also an enjoyable feature. The standard match allows a maximum of six players; three guards and three spies. The spies are pretty much young versions of Sam. They move a lot faster and have some crazy athletic moves. They have a device on their forearms that sends out signals that will break glass, interrupt the guards' weapon systems and destroy lights. The guards are controlled in first-person (unlike the spies and Sam who are controlled in third-person) and have a big-ass weapon with unlimited ammo and grenade launcher. On every map, there's four color-coded computers. The Spies' goal is to download a file from one of the computers with the forearm-device and return to the starting point. The guards goal is of course to stop the spies. Downloading the files take a lot of time, especially when you're pushing the 10 feet connection limit, but you can stop and continue the download. Although a guard is not to mess with, it seems to me like the spies are superior. The maps are laid out so that spies have a lot of room to move where the guards can't. Pretty much the only athletical moves the guards have is jumping and lowering down from heights with ropes. The spies are also extremely fast, and they tend to have enough life to avoid encounters. Guards also don't have the motion detector anymore either.There's other things to do in the multiplayer, however. There's the coop challenges, where you can play with a group of people to achieve more specific objectives. Unfortunately, there's no longer the more intimate coop that was featured in Chaos Theory. It's more about competing than working together, and there's no specific coop levels.<br\/> There's also a big bonus system, with stuff like new skins and videos.<br\/> <br\/> Double Agent is an entry in the series that's highly enjoyable, yet some changes have been made for the worse. I loved the light and sound meters and co-op gameplay in Chaos Theory, but this have been altered for the worse. The game is also a lot less about darkness, and this is also where it might disappoint. Only fans that have played the whole series will recognize them, however, and newbies can easily get into it. Splinter Cell remains a lot of fun for people who wants to infiltrate and eliminate.<br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">Level 5 brings a superb adventure of space piracy and saving the galaxy in their latest title, Rogue Galaxy. Though the game is very traditional, as far as RPG's go, it doesn't follow the Japanese style per say, trading that in for the Star Ocean style instead. In fact you will notice quite a few similarities with this title and Star Ocean III. Luckily for all involved, Star Ocean was a fantastic game and this one is just as good if not a little better. Level 5 proves that you don't have to be a big hitter the likes of Square to put out a quality role-playing game. With a mix of great implementation through gameplay and an engaging, all be it a bit predictable, storyline, rolled up in a beautiful package. Rogue Galaxy proves to be a great game to play and you will not miss those 40+ hours you sink into it.<br\/><br\/>The game follows Jaster Rogue, a small town boy who has no idea who he really is or for what purpose he is destined to fulfill. Sound familiar? It should, it has been the premise for many an RPG. Anyways, there is a war going on throughout the galaxy and up until recently Jaster's home world of Rosa has been able to stay out of it. Nevertheless, now that the inhabitance has been enslaved by the evil military faction, Jaster vows to leave and fight to end the war and free his little planet. After a case of mistaken identity, he is able to join a crew of space \"pirates\" (term used very loosely). One thing leads to another and eventually you find out that there is way more going on then just a simply conflict and of course Jaster is the key to it all. Even though three-quarters of this is simply recycled ideas from past RPG's, they obviously please the audience or they wouldn't be lasting this long. The story is well written and it sucks you in to the point where you really want to find out what the deal is with Jaster and his friends. Plus in true fashion, the ending is something to see including the very involved final boss battle(s).<br\/><br\/>Another aspect that is well implemented is the game's active action battle system. Much like Enix's work in Star Ocean, when a battle occurs, players are free to roam around a small battle area and attack in a hack and slash way. Along with a standard attack combo and a side weapon, characters also have abilities they can use to either enhance an attribute of one or all of the party, or cause damage to one or all of the foes in the battle. Item usage, weapon change, and switching characters pretty much round out the standards that make up an RPG. Anyone who was a fan of this style of battle system will not be disappointed here, it proves to be quite satisfying all the while still maintaining a good solid feeling.<br\/><br\/>Along with a well-written story and a solid battle system, the game itself just looks great. <br\/>The planets are beautiful, the beasts are well drawn, the characters are great, and the towns and scenery are just fantastic. The visuals really are stunning for a work of PS2 caliber and you would be daft not to appreciate good artistic work when you see it. Along with all the in game graphics, the cut scenes are simply breathtaking. They do a fantastic job of mixing look and feel and you will wish that there were more of them to see. What could be better then a good looking game? How bout seeing it all with no load times? That's right, aside from the initial loading of the game you get to see all these great visuals load-free. Everything from blooming light effects to excellent use of shadows give the game a great presentation<br\/><br\/>Of course presentation isn't everything. What would any good RPG be with out a system for learning abilities? Rogue Galaxy fills this requirement with a Revelation Chart for each character. Through filling this chart, the character will learn new abilities as well as increase his or her HP, elemental defense, and AP efficiency. Basically it works like this, each time you win a battle you stand a chance of getting some weird useless item. Coffee beans or an old sock are just a few examples. When you get enough of these items together, you can put them in a character's revelation chart. When you fill a particular section, the character has a \"revelation\" and learns whatever was in that section. Once a section is filled it could also open up new sections to be filled. The game does a good job of scattering items through out the game and you wont be able to completely fill anyone's chart until you get to the end of the game.<br\/><br\/>With all of this you also get a plethora of stuff to do along with the game's main story. This includes capturing, raising, training, breeding, and battling insects in the games mini-game. Every RPG has a mini-game and this one is pitting insects in blood hungry one on one combat. Luckily if that sounds completely too much like Pokemon for you, you don't have to participate in it. You won't be missing anything terribly interesting rest assured. Something that may be more worth your time however is the game's optional boss battles. It might be worth mentioning at this point that there is a list of the top 100 bounty hunters. You get points for defeating a certain number of beasts or defeating optional bosses. Jaster starts out at the very bottom of this list and, of course, there are many benefits for making all the way to the top slot. Taking on these optional bosses is crucial in claiming the top spot and they really aren't that difficult either. The game also boasts a weapon synthesis system along with an item synthesis system both of which have the ability to take up butt loads of time if you are so inclined as to dabble in them. Luckily these too are optional and will not hinder you from enjoying the story.<br\/><br\/>Much like all good RPG's, this one is not without its share of faults. The first and foremost of these problems is the games harsh difficulty level. The battles start out hard and frequent \"game over\" screens are to be expected along with many, many potions and resurrections. Unfortunately coupled with that is the game's lack of good training areas in the beginning and you never really get much of a chance until you are a bit into the game. A good analogy for the curve is like running as fast as you can into the side of a building. Once you climb the wall and get to the roof of that curve, the game levels out pretty well. This would prove to be a turn off to anyone who is not willing to spend the time to get to that point though. The story joins the difficulty in having a pretty slow start. There is a point where you are wondering if we are ever going to get to meaning behind it all. Luckily, much like Greg says in his review, that point is close in proximity to when things actually start happening. Some other notable flaws are the games score, which is pretty limp as far as RPG standards go, and the games use of roaming dialogue. As you are wandering around the various territories your three party members will speak their mind about whatever they feel like saying. This is incredibly annoying. At first the remarks about how long the player has been playing the game, and that they should probably save soon are a bit novel, but after a bit of that its just like, \"Just shut up already!\" Especially when they cycle through 4 or 5 different things and that's all. Unfortunately for us, Level 5 did not implement a way to turn this off in the options menu.<br\/><br\/>Anyone who is a fan of role-playing games will definitely have a good time with Rogue Galaxy. This title delivers on all fronts to give you an involved storyline, satisfying battles, hours of entertainment, all the while looking pretty damn good in the process. Sure the game slaps you in the face with its grueling difficulty, and rubs you the wrong way with the cycled roaming dialogue, but how many games are prefect these days? The faults don't really draw to far from making this game a great bit of fun to play and the recent price point of 20 dollars makes it a steal for the value. Those who were ready to count out the PS2 as being \"down and out\" have to rethink their analysis at this point, because Rogue Galaxy is a fantastic game that you will only find for the PlayStation 2.<br\/><br\/>8 out of 10 (4out of 5) --&gt; \"Exceeds Excellence\"<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Ninja Gaiden II is not much different from its predecessor. You play as Ryu Hayabusa, a 20-something ninja of the Dragon lineage. The story takes place six months after Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword for the DS, which in turn took place six months after Ninja Gaiden for the original Xbox.<br\/> <br\/> The Black Spider Ninja clan (introduced in NG: Dragon Sword) and their leader, Genshin, steals a statue from Ryu's father. The story spirals into a one-man war against infernal creatures referred to as Fiends, as well as the rival Black Spider Ninjas. Ryu is joined by Sonia, a CIA agent who ultimately serves the same purpose as Rachel in NG for the original Xbox - a strong, big-breasted female side-character who Ryu feels obliged to keep safe. Ryu runs into several Greater Fiends who serve as many of the bosses in the game.<br\/> <br\/> The story is presented through in-game cutscenes that tie the 14 Chapters together. NG for the original Xbox took heavy use of CG cinematics, but the strictly in-game cutscenes presented in this game are very satisfactory. The lip-syncing is usually spot on, and I am impressed by how natural the characters talk and react. The character models are also well done. Unfortunately, the story is not especially fleshed out. If you're picky about stories, you'll most likely feel like the story is tacked on. If you don't mind a B-movie script, I think you'll find the cutscenes very enjoyable to watch. The English voice-acting is usually pretty good. The adversaries have deep, bass-heavy voices that fit their characters, but the good guys usually feel cheesy with their softer voices, especially Ryu's father, who is emotion-less and bland. The Japanese voices are more thorough, and it's a nice touch that Ryu makes different sounds during combat in each language. Subtitles are available as well.<br\/> <br\/> NGII doesn't push the boundaries of graphics like NGI did for the original Xbox, but the graphics are still very good. It is certainly the best-looking Team Ninja game so far. The characters and environments are generally very good-looking. One exception that stands out is during one point in a level where you drop into what seems like giant, connecting nostrils, with long tunnels covered in an ugly shade of green. Luckily this section of the level ends pretty quickly.<br\/> <br\/> The musical score is pretty good. It's similar to other Team Ninja games, with focus on electric and drums. It fits pretty well. Sound effects are what you'd expect and cover every action.<br\/> <br\/> The level designs are linear, but with many detours usually leading to helpful items. You usually won't have a problem knowing where to go, besides a couple of times where you have to go the way you came from. This is not a puzzle game, but you will have to find a key here to open that door over there and so on, but you do this less than in NGI. Being a ninja, you'll have to use acrobatics like wall-running and water-running. You'll have to do some swimming, but you can hold your breath infinitely (unlike in NGI). The swimming controls are the same, but the Spear Gun is replaced with the Gatling Gun, which turns into a fun mini-gun instead of the tedious one-shot system of the Spear Gun.<br\/> <br\/> The game has gotten a lot of criticism for its camera. I don't think it's that bad. The camera is close on Ryu, which means that any attacks from behind are hard to predict, but I've never felt like the camera was fighting me. I'm sure anyone that invests some time into the game will get used to it pretty quickly. The camera can also be adjusted with the right stick and re-positioned behind Ryu with RT. During boss fights, the camera focuses on the boss and Ryu at the same time, which might be odd when the boss dashes across the screen, but generally the camera is fair. Still, some might be put off by it.<br\/> <br\/> Ninja Gaiden II is all about the fighting, and it doesn't disappoint. The combat is as slick as ever. NGII introduces loads of new weapons, and unlike NGI where the Dragon Sword was superior, the gap between the Dragon Sword and the rest of the weapons isn't that big. Basically every Japanese melee weapon is here, including a giant scythe and nunchucks. Long range weapons are still here, like the Fiend Bow and several kinds of Shuriken. A new feature in NGII is Obliteration Techniques. The enemies now lose limbs as you fight them, and pressing Y near a dismembered enemy inflicts a cool execution. This can be done on enemies as they are falling onto the ground, which makes it extra satisfying. Ninpos are magical techniques that inflict great damage on one or several opponents. Ultimate Techniques are attacks where the player charges an attack long enough to unleash an extreme combo on one or more opponents. Ninja Gaiden remains one of the greatest when it comes to making a satisfying combat experience.<br\/> <br\/> Slain enemies drop colored essence. Blue essence gives health. Red essence refills a slot of Ninpo. The most common, yellow essence, can be used to buy items or upgrades at the many shops in the game, or to speed up an Ultimate Technique. As well as these shops you will find Dragon Statues, where you can save your game and fully heal yourself. The new health meter replenishes itself when your enemies are killed, but the maximum health available is constantly drained as you take damage, which means you have to find a way to heal all the way up again, usually by visiting a Dragon Statue.<br\/> <br\/> NGI was a challenging game, and it seems as Team Ninja took this as a compliment. Although the beginning of NGII is a nice introduction to new players, the difficulty gets a bit high later in the game. There are four difficulties, and I recommend anyone to do the lowest one first. I didn't find it very hard, but some of the bosses were a bit hard to crack. On the leaderboards it says I completed my first playthrough at 8.5 hours (not counting continues) with 55 continues. I assure you over 40 of those were at some of the later bosses. I only used the Dragon Sword, as there are achievements for completing the game only using the specified weapon. Some parts may seem cheap, like how the giant Armadillo explodes after you kill it, but you'll realize that it's not actually cheap. In this instance, simply holding block will save you from dying or having to use a Talisman of Rebirth. So although the game can feel too difficult or even cheap at first, I guarantee that you will get past it once you get more used to the enemies.<br\/> <br\/> There is no multiplayer in this game besides Leaderboards and Cinema mode where you can record your play and share with friends, though uploading is apparently restricted to a certain part of the leaderboards. It's good that the game sports some achievements with replay value, like achievements for finding every Crystal Skull, completing each Test of Valor (a sort of a challenge that can be accessed at some points in the game), completing the game using just one weapon and completing it on each difficulty. I plan on going through the game many times.<br\/> <br\/> If you're looking for the same experience that made NGI great, you shouldn't be disappointed. The game introduces loads of weapons, enemies and some fun dismembering, but is essentially more of the same. In this case, I don't see that as a bad thing. Casual gamers might want to stay away, since the difficulty can be high even on the lowest setting. Still, Ninja Gaiden II is a worthy sequel that provides extremely slick and satisfying action.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Lego Indiana Jones Review<br\/><br\/><br\/>Being a fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and one of the few people who really liked Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, naturally I've been very eager for an Indiana Jones game. L ego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures seems to be the closest I'm going to get for a little while. Having only briefly played Lego Star Wars I didn't know what to expect from Lego Indiana Jones, but after playing the game I'm mostly pleased. From what I've heard about the Star Wars games this game plays very similar.\u00a0<br\/><br\/><br\/>The basic gameplay of Lego Indiana Jones is much the same as the Lego Star Wars games, building things out of Lego to solve puzzles. The only real difference being instead of using the force you're using your hands to physically build things, and instead of a light saber you have a whip. At first the puzzles will be varied and entertaining to figure out but as you start to progress through game you'll realise that you're doing the same tasks over and over again. So by the time you get up to the Temple of Doom story arc some things will feel a bit like a chore and the only real reason you're playing through the whole thing is to see your favorite Indy moments made out of Lego. Each chapter of the games story arcs allow you to play as 2 or more characters depending on where you are in the game. You'll need to switch between the characters given to you to solve puzzles. Each character has there own special abilities, for example Indiana will swing across things using his whip and women characters will jump higher than the male characters. This makes a lot of puzzles feel different even though there the same old thing you've been doing over and over. Also like the Lego Star Wars games there are a lot of hidden collectibles to dig up during the levels which unlock different characters and levels. These can be accessed through Barnett College which acts as the middle area between the chapters of the game. After completing a chapter it allows you to free play it with any of the characters you've unlocked to find the collectibles you may have missed on your first play through giving the game a lot of replay value.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The story of Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures covers the first three Indiana Jones films, hence the title. Each story arc is split into 6 chapters. The different stories can be played in any order, so if you just want to play through 'The Last Crusade' and not the other two films you can. But that would be a tremendous waste of money considering how short the game already is. One of the games flaws is definitely its length; each story arc can be completed in 2 hours at the very most making the game only last about 4-5 hours for the average gamer. But hey its still Lego and Indiana Jones so I'll take what I'm given.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The games graphics are nearly identical to the Lego Star War's games, but that was expected. How could they improve graphics where nearly everything is Lego. All the objects in the game world that you can interact with are made out of Lego so there will aren't many issues graphically, besides some objects looking pretty similar. I didn't experience any frame rate issues while playing. At the start and end of each chapter you'll be treated to hilarious cut scenes, which look no different to the gameplay graphically. There's not much to say about the games graphics, just that there Lego.<br\/><br\/><br\/>As soon as you load the game you'll be treated to the Indiana Jones theme song, get used to it because you're going to be hearing it a lot. The games score consists of all the music you've heard from the films, so if you're a fan of the movies it will feel very familiar but it gets tiresome. You'll here the same music a lot, which will make you want to turn the volume down unless you like getting tunes stuck in your head. There is no dialogue in the game making it even more like the Star Wars games. You'll be treated to sort of a distorted mumbling sound during the cut scenes which is a good thing considering it fits perfectly with the feel of the game.<br\/><br\/><br\/>I didn't want to have to compare this game to the Lego Star Wars game but I have to, the games are pretty much the same besides the different characters and story. Even if you haven't played Lego Star Wars a whole lot you'll feel like you've played the game before. If you're looking for a well thought out, lengthy game you're not going to get it from this. But if your looking for a quick game that will take your mind off things for a few hours, this games for you.<br\/><br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p> <\/p><p> Assassins Creed is an engaging game the first time you experience what it has to offer. Clearly the best part of the game is the movement of which Alta\u00efr is able to complete, as he can leap and move in ways similar to the activity of 'Parkour'. The movement of Altair is fantastic, especially when watching him crookedly climb upwards to the top of a building or running   across  the roofs of houses to escape the guards of the city. This is undeniably the strongest part of Assassins Creed as it is thrilling to watch his realistic movement. Alta\u00efrs use of the cities is also great, which reminds me of early Tomb Raider climbing in the search for specific ledges. Assassins Creed develops this style of movement but branches out further, and uses more of the buildings small architecture. This allows for a more realistic style of climbing. <br\/> <br\/> The graphics in the game are generally great.  But there are small noticeable glitches throughout, which take away from the immersion.  <br\/> <br\/> Assassins Creed Is fantastic for the movement and graphics, but the game is brought down by technical issues and the plot. The end of the game is unsatisfying and left me wanting more from the story, which is   disappointing  as the start of the game nicely set up the base plot. Towards the end of the game I felt the story growing less engaging and more an 'add-on' the game. One of the main reasons for feeling not attached is the dull assassinations that are assigned to you throughout the game. After the second or third killing that you are forced to commit, you soon  realise  that this is all that the game has to offer. There is no different approach to the killings either, just attack from your own angle, and kill. That\u2019s it.<br\/> <br\/> The fighting system is simple and fun to watch, but it easily becomes repetitive.  The motions of these fights are good, but like many other parts of the game it becomes a strain and does not differ in movement or look.  <br\/> <br\/> Some of the AI in the game can be considered unfinished as there actions are questionable at points. In the time I spent playing this game, I successfully counted six enemy guards getting stuck in the walls and   that\u2019s  not even considering the civilians in the game. Basically these small bugs withdraw from the games atmosphere and really take away from the games belief.<br\/> <br\/> Putting the issues aside that Assassins Creed has, I still found parts of the game enjoyable. I feel that because of the hype and excitement that built up the game it was a   disappointment  that  Ubisoft  would not work on the things such as - improve the fighting mechanics or 'Iron out' the small glitches that all bring down the game.\u00a0 After talking to other people about there views on this game, I decided that Assassins Creed is a game that either grabs you or   isn\u2019t  that interesting at many points. I personally recommend that if you feel Assassins Creed looks impressive that you first rent out the game.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">Not a very creative title. I suppose I could have put a bit more effort into it. Although the same could be said about Ken Levine and The Biggest Disappointment in Gaming History\u2026 Hey, that\u2019s not a bad title.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">BioShock\u2019s biggest problem is that it doesn\u2019t live up to the incredibly high expectations set by the master and commander Levine, hell, it doesn\u2019t even live up to the mediocre expectations of any shooter\/RPG\/epic story game. The game starts out on a solid premise, underwater dystopia? Awesome. Genetically modified supermen? Incredible! BioShock? Disappointing. As a shooter BioShock is serviceable. You have your running, you have your gunning, but in the end it adds nothing new to the genre. As an RPG it is limited. There are no classes in BioShock, instead there are multi-level perks and powers to upgrade your character with. The perks modify health or mechanical abilities but they are basically a second thought. What had everyone wet for BioShock were the powers genetically spliced into you. Basically you have fire, freeze, and electricity, throw in some bees for fun but you won\u2019t need the rest. When I say the powers and perks are multi-level I mean that in a purely statistical sense, Fire level 1 looks and acts exactly like Fire level 3. You can also upgrade weapons but you can\u2019t upgrade all of the weapons fully with one run through so you have to choose carefully. My suggestion? DON\u2019T.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">This brings me to BioShock\u2019s next glaring flaw; it is too damn easy. The basic enemies, and by basic enemies I mean <i>any<\/i> enemy that isn\u2019t a Big Daddy or a boss, can be taken out with the Freeze-Them-and-Beat-Them-With-Your-Wrench Combo (or as it is called in the game; The ol\u2019 One-Two combo). And since it is the best way to dispose of the underwater mutants there is really no reason, outside of trying every weapon once (and some you will only try once) and running out of EVE, to ever use anything else. And for the other guys, the Big Daddies, the true stars of Bioshock, well, they really don\u2019t offer up any more of a challenge than any other bad guy, except they are tougher. That is unless you have a fully upgraded shotgun, or just some Electro-Gel, that\u2019s the stuff that the 60\u2019s Batman would have whipped out of his all-purpose utility belt and called Big Daddy repellent. But, if you\u2019re looking for a challenge though, I recommend a different game, when you succumb to the throes of death there is only a negligible penalty so there is really nothing but Ken Levine telling you to \u201cuse traps and the environment against the Big Daddies\u201d stopping you from just charging the Big Daddy until it bites the dust. \u201cSo, why wouldn\u2019t I use traps and the environment against the Big Daddies?\u201d you might ask. Aside from me telling you that you don\u2019t have to, there aren\u2019t really any to speak of. As far as environmental hazards you got water and gas. Burn the gas, shock the water. Next. Traps, the possibilities are limited, how limited? You get one. Crossbow tripwires. Awesome!<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">Well, at least those genetically mutated supermen (and women) are cool. All FIVE enemy models have a recognizable human form, bloody face, and dirty clothes. Some have hooks, for the life of me I can\u2019t imagine who thought that would be an improvement. The only enemy models that break from the traditional five are the bosses. Aesthetically they are basically exactly the same, aside from a change of clothes and really that makes all the difference. Physically they are just a stronger version of one of the enemy types. None of them offer up much anything in terms of a challenge and really they are just benchmark to let you know how much more you have to put up with. The final benchmark, the final boss, is the one that breaks all preconceived notions about what an genetically altered citizen of an underwater dystopia can look like, and he will have you laughing all the way to the credits. For a mental picture think Zed from the original Power Rangers, minus the awesome. But with this incredibly underdesigned model comes sweet relief, the end, the stunning conclusion. Apparently there are 3 alternate endings, I would have loved to sit through the 12 hour campaign again and focus on not killing the Little Sisters, I mean ripping out sea slugs, to see the montage of blue tinted pictures accompanied by a dramatic voice over but by that time I had already sold back my copy to GameStop for 14 bucks\u2026 suckers.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about isn\u2019t it? Levine called out the limited RPG elements and the bare bones shooting and instead offered us an \u201cemotionally gripping thrill ride that is BioShock\u201d. That\u2019s not an actual quote, or maybe it is, who cares. To me listening to tape decks isn\u2019t exactly \u2018emotionally gripping,\u2019 usually when dealing with a visual medium I like to actually SEE what is going on. The tape deck system isn\u2019t a story telling device, it\u2019s a brilliant ploy to by Ken Levine not to hire animators. There are no FMVs, no cut scenes, just in game cinematics that are mediocre at best. Even the end is just a bunch of pictures with a voice over telling you that you saved or destroyed the world. But I will admit, when I first played BioShock I thought I liked it, when playing I bought into the reviews and the hype, I had too. I mean I dropped 60 bucks on it. But when it was all said and done, when the credits rolled on BioShock a feeling of emptiness swept over me. I felt used, violated, and mocked. Mocked by Ken Levine and his BioShock. Ken was laughing at me, laughing at everyone who bought his shtick, and we bought it wholesale. Everything in BioShock is undercooked, we get tape decks when we should have cut scenes, we get FIVE enemies when we should get Twenty-Five, and we get cartoony graphics when we should get arresting visuals depth and life. We get it all under the name of \u2018art\u2019 that\u2019s how Ken sold it to us, a piece of art. It is not art. It is a gimmick, a sales pitch, a safety net that let Ken put out a product with minimal effort.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">By now I\u2019m sure everyone who reads this will have bought or at least played BioShock but if this review can stop one, just one person from making the same mistake so many of us did I will die a happy reviewer. Jeff Gerstmann himself as you may remember gave this game a shinning review, a 9 out of 10 on the .5 increment GameSpot scale, but I say it is not too late! You are free of your shackles, I too fell for the game when I played it but now time has passed remember, remember the game for what it is. I implore you to right the wrongs of yesterday, absolve yourself of your sins and revaluate this game. If not for me then for you own soul.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0.0001pt; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in; \"><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \"><span>-<span style=\"font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; font-size:7pt; \">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size:10pt; \">Aquaman<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Ah. Burnout. Possibly the greatest arcade racing series ever. Well, the first two titles might not have been the greatest, but after EA stepped in, things changed. For the better. Burnout 3: Takedown was groundbreaking and deserved the critical acclaim it achieved. Dodging traffic at incredible speeds while taking out opponents was easily affiliated to Burnout 3. This time, everything is turned up a notch.<br\/> <br\/> The first thing you\u2019ll notice is the new slick menu interface with one of the game\u2019s faster vehicles blazing trough traffic in the background. Create your profile and the game will see if you have a Burnout 3 or Madden 06 save file. If you have one of these you\u2019ll get an extra car in Crash mode. Two if you have both save files. Now you can get started on the World Tour to get new cars, play one of the games multiplayer modes or dive into Xbox Live.<br\/> The first event you\u2019ll play in World Tour is Traffic Attack in one of the game\u2019s sunnier tracks, Sunshine Keys. Traffic Attack is the new mode in Burnout Revenge and introduces Traffic Checking. In Revenge, you can \u201ccheck\u201d traffic by ramming into them. You can only hit same-way traffic that\u2019s smaller than trailers and big rigs, though. This is a good thing, because it would have been too easy if you could just blaze trough traffic. Also, it allows for much more traffic without it getting too difficult. Still, it would be nice if there were more big rigs and trailers to avoid. You can also do Traffic Check Takedowns by launching traffic into opponents. In Traffic attack, your car is armed with explosives and a countdown on the top of the screen shows when the bomb will go off. When the timer goes below 20 seconds, checking traffic increases your time left. Your goal in Traffic Attack is to score big by checking traffic while keeping your timer over 0.00. The fastest way to earning scores and gaining seconds on the clock is by doing trick and skill shots. For example, send a van flying onto an oncoming bus to get an Awesome Skill Shot.<br\/> <br\/> Awesome is a word you\u2019ll want to see often in Burnout Revenge. It\u2019s the best you can get in the new rating system. Your driving is rated while you drive, ranging from OK to Awesome. Doing Takedowns and skillful stunts like Awesome Drift quickly heightens your rating. Get a Gold Medal and an Awesome rating to Perfect an event. This\u2019ll earn you 5 stars that add up to your rank. There are 10 ranks in the game. You\u2019ll start with Harmless and finally reach the last rank, Elite. Reaching Elite Rank also unlocks a car based on a certain upcoming shooting game from Criterion, makers of the Burnout series. Ranks are reached by earning enough stars. Stars are obtained by getting medals and ratings in events. As before mentioned, getting Awesome rating and a Gold Medal gives you five stars, while getting a less great result gives less stars. Reaching Elite Rank is way too easy, as you don\u2019t even need to Perfect most of the events. It feels too short when you rank up almost every time, often without even starting many of the events in your previous ranks. Each rank unlocks its own series of events spread around some of the tracks in Revenge.<br\/> <br\/> The tracks of Burnout have been heavily improved from Burnout 3, with lots of jumps and shortcuts to vary the experience. With all these jumps, Revenge also introduces the new Vertical Takedowns. Simply do a jump and mysteriously manage to land on an opponent to do one of these. You\u2019ll need to do a Vertical Takedown in each location as it is one of the 8 Challenges found in every Challenge Sheet for the game\u2019s 8 locations. Clever mathematicians can easily calculate that there are a total of 64 challenges, although not very (or at all) different from location to location. Other challenges include blowing up 25 vehicles in a Crash event at Sunshine Keys (the hardest in my opinion) and taking down a special car in a race event. This is usually a car that stands out from your other opponents, probably a Special car like the Logitech Racer (an F1 with Logitech Decals). Another challenge is to do a certain amount of Revenge Takedowns. Revenge Takedowns are achieved by taking out an opponent that has taken you out. Complete the Challenge Sheet for a location to unlock a Special car.<br\/> <br\/> Let\u2019s talk Crash. It\u2019s awesome. This time around, it\u2019s even better. Unfortunately, the quantity is heavily decreased from Burnout 3\u2019s 100 Crash events to fewer, but much bigger events. Still, the quality doesn\u2019t seem good enough to make up for the loss of quantity. The Crash mode has seen great changes this time. The first you\u2019ll notice is the Golf-style meter that determines your car\u2019s acceleration. Remember the tricky spin\/release gas\/throttle combinations you had to perform to start with a boost in Burnout 3? Now you just need to hit the green spots to get a Perfect start and a full boost. Most crash locations have big jumps. Jumping in Crash mode feels breathtaking and the weight and wind on your car affects the way you control in-air. Hit traffic and let her rip! Watch as traffic pile up and use your Aftertouch cleverly to position your car where you want it. As traffic gets damaged and more cars are mixed in the pile-up(s), your Boost meter grows. When it reaches 100% you need to button-mash B to set off the Crashbreaker. The button-mashing seems a little stupid though, especially as the cars with greater Crashbreakers are impossible to use fully as your thumb is not fast enough. You can also use the Crashbreaker several times, as long as the meter grows to 100%. On the upper-left corner on the screen there\u2019s a counter that shows how many cars have been involved in the pile-up, and how many vehicles there are in total. There\u2019s of course a great challenge if you want to get all vehicles to join the pile-up(s), which is not easy. The Crash cars you drive yourself are not particularly impressive compared to the ones in Burnout 3. I really miss the Fire Truck\u2026 And even here the cars come in updated versions, which has always been the worst aspect of the Burnout series.<br\/> <br\/> Oh yes. The cars! Criterion got there own car designers, and boy did they do well! The cars are incredibly stylish. There\u2019s a total of 78 cars (80 if you have the two save files) in Revenge. The \u201cnormal\u201d cars are the cooler ones. The two cars you start with have a boost speed of 160 mph and have similar designs as the Sport and Super classes in Burnout 3. So no silly compact cars this time! You\u2019ll unlock cars fast, as Revenge suffers from being too easy for anyone familiar with the Burnout series. Burnout Revenge also updates there vehicles, apparently not caring that it\u2019s the weaker aspects of the series\u2026 You could say they\u2019re in 3 classes; ST, DX and GT. But they\u2019re not ordered like in Burnout 3. They\u2019re ordered after how good they are or how exclusive they are. Finding your favorite car simply means horizontally scrolling through the many vehicles. There are really just 16 cars that have a really unique design when not counting Crash or Special cars\u2026 For example, a Factory M-Type DX is an updated version of the Factory M-Type ST, while the Factory Type GT is an updated version of the Factory M-Type DX. So there are 46 cars that are won by completing events in World Tour, plus the two you start with, the 12 Special cars you\u2019ll get by achieving certain goals and 18 Crash vehicles. Then there\u2019s two extra that are unlocked by having certain save files\u2026 Strangely, I got 100% before I should have, simply because I have an extra car from my Burnout 3 save file. I still miss 2 Signature Takedowns to get the last Special car and a rightful 100%\u2026<br\/> Signature Takedowns are back, with a total of 24 (3 in each location).<br\/> <br\/> You\u2019ve also got the modes from Burnout 3, like Road Rage, Race, Eliminator, Preview and Burning Lap. Some of these have changed. In the Eliminator mode the last placed driver is eliminated per 30-seconds, not per lap. And the timer in Road Rage has changed too. It\u2019s much shorter, often starting at 30-50 seconds, but time is extended by doing 2 or 3 takedowns before time runs out. Another cool change is the Crashbreaker events. Race, Road Rage and Eliminator includes Crashbreakers in the later ranks! Just like in Burnout 3\u2019s Crash mode, press B to set off the Crashbreaker. This is only available if you\u2019ve crashed or have been taken out. Take an opponent with you in the explosion to get an Explosive Payback. Of course, taking more opponents with you means bigger score and bigger chance to win. The best is Total Payback, where you blow up all 5 opponents (Race or Eliminator). Hit no one at all, and you\u2019ll waste your boost.<br\/> <br\/> This is also an excellent Live and multiplayer game.<br\/> <br\/> The racing itself is great. Everything blurs and the screen tends to shake. Especially when jumping in Crash, as everything shakes and feels like the big jump it is.<br\/> <br\/> Now\u2026 Music! The featured soundtrack includes 41 songs from artists like The Doors, Animal Alpha, Yellowcard, The Chemical Brothers and LCD Soundsystem. My favorite song is The Big Jump by The Chemical Brothers. That beat is so awesome\u2026 The soundtrack is improved from Burnout 3, but still has a bit too much punk rock over it. It\u2019s more hard-core rock (Animal Alpha is an example) and Techno (The Bravery is an example), thankfully. But of course, Xbox owners like me can easily switch to custom soundtracks and listen to their favorite music, in my case Rap. That\u2019s my fizzle, drizzle\u2026<br\/> The sound effects are also amazing, especially in Crash. You can almost feel the explosions and the metal crushing!<br\/> <br\/> All in all, Burnout Revenge actually isn\u2019t the best in the series. All of these new features and improvements mean nothing when the difficulty is so incredibly easy. The 169 events are simply unchallenging, even the timed races that were so hard in Burnout 3. There\u2019s also room for improvements. There are plenty of obvious glitches that haven\u2019t been sorted out, like the Crash Cam appearing when you haven\u2019t crashed yet and so on. They still need to vary the car designs more and turn up the difficulty. And there\u2019s no Single Race! And what happened to Crash FM? I didn\u2019t like it in Burnout 3, but they could have tried improving it and not just limit it to introduction and training videos! I found that voice to be damn sexy\u2026<br\/> But still, this is an awesome racer. You\u2019ll get all the things that made Burnout 3 great and more, especially if you thought it was too hard, but anyone looking for a challenging Burnout game might be disappointed.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">Who nowadays hasn\u2019t gotten their proverbial rock on with some guitar hero by now? Whether it was Ozzy who did it for you in the first Guitar Hero or the sweet sound of the Allman Brothers from the second, chances are you have come across this phenomenon by now. Well in the style of milking cash cows for all they\u2019re worth, Activision gives us yet another game to wet our appetites with. Which ordinarily would be a good thing, right?<br\/><br\/>We have all heard it before so let me get it out of the way: Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80\u2019s is a $50 expansion pack. There end of review. Oh you want more? Well this is basically a dig at their well. You get thirty songs, which is like the first game. Difference is, you don\u2019t get anything else. 30 songs, that\u2019s the game. Sure it has some characters to choose from, six, and some venues, six and of course lots of guitars to make your dude cool looking, but there is a severe lack of substance. This game just has no meat on it. Breaking it down, we work first on the charactors. You will find there are the classics, good ol\u2019 Johnny, tough as nails Axel, gothic Judy, pop star Izzy, crazy hairdo Pandora, and the store bought Grim. So what is the problem with them? Well taking aside the fact that there are two missing, Winston and Xavior, the characters have a very recycled feel to them, much like the rest of the game. They haven\u2019t really touched them up from Guitar Hero II. Aside from updating their appearance, they still look for the most part lifeless as far as facial and body expressions. While they are playing, they don\u2019t have a guitar strap, (that bothers me to all kinds of craziness!) they have these generic rock pose cycles that they go through that look just plain lame, and they just don\u2019t have a good sense of personality. Given the fact that you only get six characters to express your inner rock, they could have at least touched them up to handle more of the feeling.<br\/><br\/>The venues haven\u2019t changed with the exception of, again updating appearance. Like the characters, they aren\u2019t all present. Those who liked Stonehenge from the second will be saddened to find it painfully missing from this iteration. Though, to be fair, the track list is shorter so they couldn\u2019t break them evenly. The grand finale is just you exploding no space ship taking you off and changing the stars. (That was a really nice touch I though!) So here again we have a nice solid feeling of recycled napkin or tissue whichever metaphor you enjoy.<br\/><br\/>That aside lets get down to why anyone in their right mind would buy this game in the first place, the songs man, the songs! These don\u2019t leave you hanging too much. Notably the master tracks, though you may be unsure if Flock of Seagulls is something you want to experience first hand, few can argue with Judas Priest\u2019s Electric Eye. (They even put the Hellion in too!) All in all there are about 10 to 20 songs that you would actually want to play. Does anyone know why X\u2019s Las Angles was added in there? That song is just the worst example of tone deaf awfulness that I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with. The technical level of the songs on the harder modes still gives that same satisfying feeling which is important. You really feel an accomplishment when you can blaze through Play With Me, or in my case stumble through without failing! The biggest problem in the game, though, is the complete lack of dueling guitars. All the songs play guitar\/bass on two-player coop. We all know that Glenn and K. K. wouldn\u2019t appreciate that on their masterpiece and I don\u2019t appreciate it either. This is just another blatant example of how to milk a cash cow without much effort.<br\/><br\/>So what is the bottom line? I gave this game a 6 out of 10 which puts it at \u201cFun\u201d on my scale. I would say that if you seriously like at least half of the songs on this game and you really don\u2019t mind paying full price for a half-butt attempt, pick it up. If anything else it gives you just that many more ways to rock out. It is Guitar Hero and that is all that matters in the end isn't it?<br\/>6 out of 10 (3 out of 5) &gt; \"Fun\"<\/span><\/p>",

All of the quests are pretty much kill a bunch of monsters or collect an item from a dungeon with the occasional boss battle waiting at the end. As you do you will level up earning new upgrades for your equipment, which are needed to comfortably play through the later quests. At the start of the game you'll be given the opportunity to select which character class you would like to be. These include: Warrior, Archer and Sorceress. Each have there own fighting styles and Alter Ego forms. Alter Ego forms are special abilities that your character can use to transform into a big beast (relating to your characters class) to help clear away some monsters quickly.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The story is very transparent a long winded. You'll never feel like you're involved in the story and near the end of the game you'll just want it to finish.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The sound and graphics are average. The level design is very plain and you can tell that a lot of it was recycled. Most of the monsters sound strikingly similar and there is no dialogue but that's to be expected from a Xbox Live Arcade Title.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Arkadian Warriors is a fun Arcade title that has very basic game play that draws heavily from games like Diablo.

      "deck": "Great simulator with unmatched realism and a smart AI",
      "description": "<p>This is one of the greatest racing simulators to hit videogames so far.<br\/> <br\/> There are a total of 231 cars in the game, unless I remembered wrong. These, like you would expect, range from Honda Civic SI Hatchback to Chrysler ME Four-Twelve to Toyota GT-One! These are again divided in classes; D4, D3, D2, D1, C4, C3, C2, C1, B4, B3, B2, B1, A4, A3, A2, A1, S4, S3, S2, S1, GT, GTS and P1.<br\/> <br\/> D to S cars are (somewhat) street-legal cars with D4 being slowest and S1 being fastest. GT and GTS are the sort of racing-only cars you'll see in championships, usually street-legal cars tuned way beyond street-legal... Like Mercedes-Benz CLK DTM. P1 are the fastest, purpose-built cars like Toyota GT-One.<br\/> <br\/> Your car's class change when you upgrade it though. A stock D car can quickly get into the S class if you have the money! The quickest way through classes is with the engine. 700 horsepowers under the hood is never a bad thing, but racing-only tires and decreased weight is always helpful. These are not the only options for modding though. Engine upgrades include Turbos, Superchargers, Intercoolers and so on. Aero and visual upgrades include Hoods, Rims, Bumpers, Window Tinting, Spoilers and more. Chassis and Drivetrain include Suspension, Tires, Weight Reduction, brakes, etc. Aero\/visual upgrades are usually limited or few according to your car. A Honda Civic can have plenty, but you can't change anything but rims and tints on a Ferrari Enzo...<br\/> <br\/> Painting your car is really awesome. There are the typical painting options where you can separately paint the base, hood or maybe mirrors and spoilers depending on your car. <br\/> <br\/> Then there are the decals and vinyls. You change the position of where you paint by moving the thumbstick up or down. Left side, right side, rear, front, above (hood, roof, etc) and spoiler (if your car has one) can be decorated with 100 decals\/vinyls on each side! The number of decals also depends on your car... Vinyls are not too many, but you can spin and stretch and tilt them to make crazy combinations, but it would still be nice with more vinyls... You can also do the same with decals, but you can't stretch a decal horizontally but not vertically. My only complaint with the decals is that they often look chunky when resized. There's some useful \"Layer Options\" as well. These are options like Cut, Copy, Insert, Delete and the useful Paste All Layers From Left Side (assuming you\u2019re on the right side).<br\/> <br\/> The excellent graphics makes painting much more fun than in tuner games like NFS Underground 2. Not as good as in GT4, but still very good.<br\/> <br\/> Another thing I should mention is the carbon-fiber options. Like in other tuners you can't paint carbon-fiber parts. In this game they look darker than in other tuners as well.<br\/> <br\/> With the GT, GTS and P1 cars you can't change a thing except for small tuning like gear-ratios, tire pressure and downforce. There are more tuning options though.<br\/> <br\/> With some \"pre-tuned\" cars you usually can't change painting and decals\/vinyls. With \"pre-tuned\" I mean cars like Honda Mugen S2000 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI Tommy Makinen. There's a lot of this kind of cars in the game. There's probably 5 different Mazda RX-7's in the game, some \"normal\", some not...<br\/> <br\/> Oh yeah, maybe I should mention the actual racing... As I've mentioned, the realism is unmatched and the AI is really smart. There's a really good damage modeling with both visuals and performance being affected. All the cars handle differently and are definitely affected by modifications and small tuning like Tire Pressure and Downforce.<br\/> <br\/> Racing modes are none out of the ordinary. There's Arcade mode, Career mode, Free run and similar. Arcade mode is, well Arcade.... Complete all races with the car of your choice, whether it's from your Garage or from a certain class, to unlock new cars available in Free Run, Time Attack and Arcade. This has no effect in Career, though.<br\/> <br\/> Career mode is very typical. Race in different events to win cars and money. When you start Career mode you can choose from Europe, Asia and North-America as starting point. I chose Europe and could choose from cars like Audi TT and Volkswagen Golf as my first car. Choosing region also affects car prices and unlockables. When you\u2019re in Europe a Volvo costs less, while a Honda or Ford costs more. Naturally. It affects unlockables because the cars you win by reaching a certain level are changed. Levels are reached by making money from races. Not by selling cars and\/or parts... For example, when I reached lvl 5 I won a partnership with Acura and a free Acura NSX!<br\/> <br\/> By reaching levels you don't only win cars, you also get discount on car parts. By reaching the final level, 50, parts are pretty cheap 'cause of the 50% discount!<br\/> <br\/> The events in Career mode are often limited to stuff like a certain class or engine power. This also means that an A1 Toyota Supra would be better in an A-only event than as a S4 car in an S-only event, forcing you to think before tuning a car to the max.<br\/> <br\/> The garage has space for seemingly unlimited cars, and you can buy the same car over and over again to tune it differently.<br\/> <br\/> Still, there are some bugs and such. For example, adding vinyls might look weird on some cars or the \"Paste All Layers From Left\/Right Side\" function doesn't work correctly. Another disappointment is the length in the races. I just don't bother racing 2 laps in N\u00fcrburgring to complete one fifth of an event....<br\/> <br\/> The music is produced by JunkieXL, which means lame guitar tunes, but there's a customized soundtracks option. The music plays all the time and it remembers what kind of music you selected and if it's random or from start to finish.<br\/> <br\/> The difficulty can be customized, whether its AI skill or aids like Traction Control System and Driving Aid. Driving Aid is a dynamic Throttle-Brake-Turn\" helper which turns red when you should brake and green when you should throttle, displayed as arrows on the ground. Sometimes it's better not to obey it completely. It tends to underestimate your car\/skills...<br\/> <br\/> All in all, this is an awesome racer with an awesome tuning option. Why is it better than GT4? Awesome tuning, amazing AI, cool damage modeling and so on.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\">Welcome to the Black Mesa Research Facility. With that one sentence, the entire world of video gaming as we knew it changed forever. Gordon Freeman became something of gaming legend. Everyone knows at least one aspect or another of his historical journey to the surface and beyond. The game of course is Half-Life, and it is quite hard to forget. Through its ingenious use of imagination, creativity, and programming, this game has left its mark in every first person shooter to date. This game is at the same level as Doom for breakthrough performances.<br\/><br\/>Like most gamers, you would think of Half-Life as a PC game, and by all means, it is, but some people prefer consoles rather then a PC. Therefore this wont be a comparison between the two, this is strictly a review of the PlayStation2 version as if it wasn\u2019t a PC game at all. That being said, lets get started.<br\/><br\/>This game has one incredible story. As the game starts out, you play as the sub-level scientist Gordon Freeman working in an underground research facility. You begin the day as ordinary as any other with an analysis of some strange mineral samples. That is where the ordinary comes to a screeching halt. Something goes terribly wrong and you find yourself as the only person with enough sanity left to piece together just what exactly happened and try to put things back together. Through countless layer upon layer, you slowly work your way to the surface to uncover exactly what is going on. From the revolutionary intro sequence, to the creepy government agent guy, and through to the heart pounding end, this game delivers on all fronts. It is excellent to the fullest extent of the word and you would be hard pressed to find someone who says otherwise.<br\/><br\/>The actual game play isn\u2019t half bad. The control scheme, as with most console FPS, takes some getting used to. Once you have mastered the aim timing and movement sensitivity, you are pretty much good to go. The main thing that becomes almost immediately annoying is the brief but constant load times between sequences. You won\u2019t be sitting there for long but right when you are getting into the game, or hurrying to find health and recover, which you will be doing constantly, you get this polite little Loading message. But with the given technology you can\u2019t expect much in that regard, it doesn\u2019t really take much away from the experience anyways. It is just something worth mentioning. Throughout the game you will battle many different types of foes to get to your overall objective, which changes as the story progresses. After completing the game you have the opportunity to play through another sequence of events characterized with the game\u2019s second main mode, coop. This is an awesome addition to the game since the main story itself is worth getting, but to also get this extra little game mode, well that is just to good to pass up. This works in a series of level like sequences where you and your buddy get rated as to how well you do overall. The main story is long, about 30 maybe 40 hours of straight playing time, and the coop, though it isn\u2019t very long has good replay value. All in all that gives the game a pretty decent appeal all things considered.<br\/><br\/>I would try to put something negative about the game down but frankly, there just isn\u2019t anything bad about it. This game is spectacular! Everyone should play though it at least once even if they don\u2019t buy it for themselves. The game gets a perfect 10 out of 10 from my scale, which puts it at \u201cRevolutionary.\u201d Truly a title that few ever achieve on my list, but this game, even though it may not be the \u201cgrand daddy\u201d of all shooters (I suspect Doom would have that honor,) it definitely lifts and defines the bar for what a FPS could and should look like. Bottom line: get it. This game deserves to be in everyone\u2019s collection. <span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Unicode MS'\"><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>DOA Ultimate is a remake of Dead Or Alive 2 and 1. You'll get one disc for each game in the same package. DOA 1 (being the Saturn game it is) is a look back at the primitive yet slightly enjoyable game that started it all. Not a bad game at all, but the casual gamer probably won't be playing this game too much. DOA 2 however, is extremely polished and has tremendous graphics. My biggest complaint is the lack of moves. Many of my favourites moves and combo throws from DOA 3 is absent in DOA 2, but the reason is of course that they weren't on the original DOA 2... This robs the game of gameplay and was very unwanted with me.<br\/> <br\/> The arenas are pretty cool, with many more stairs and stuff, but there's just too few of them.<br\/> <br\/> DOA 2 features a large amount of costumes, where some characters (like Kasumi) can have 20 costumes. Of course the later costumes are from the Xtreme Beach Volleyball game and will bring joy to many breast-lovers out there... The costumes are 137 in total and there's only 2 per character who doesn't need to be unlocked! These are unlocked by completing Story mode with the character you need costumes for. Or if you have unlocked the unlockable characters (you need a DOA 3 save file to unlock the last one) you can collect all items in Survival mode to completely unlock all costumes and extras. These extras include G4TV's look behind the Dead Or Alive series, GC gallery (collection of sexy pics from DOA XBV) and a booster which you can use to get the costumes for your DOA 3 file! The latter is the extra I cared most about... But once you've gotten all the 66 items in Survival (which takes surprisingly short time) there isn't much to do! If you're like me and have played through DOA 3's Story mode uncountable times and remember almost every move sequence from the characters, gameplay falls to zero in DOA Ultimate. Here's where Live play comes in, though. It's a good Live function, but the lack of moves makes it a lesser experience than it could have been if there was Live on DOA 3...<br\/> <br\/> The sound in the game is what you'll expect: lame music, but cool sound effects and shouts.<br\/> <br\/> The Story mode in DOA Ultimate is very disappointing. It explains nearly nothing and has a total of maybe 5 minutes with video per character that's not even CG! And the final boss is a clich\u00e9 in looks and a downer in the moves department. And there's only 7 stages.<br\/> <br\/> Brad Wong, Christie and Hayate are missing in DOA Ultimate, only Tengu (the boss) is new in the game. And if you don't have a DOA 3 save file either, Hitomi isn't playable.<br\/> <br\/> All in all, this is a DOA game and therefore a great fighting game, but since it's a remake of DOA 2 and 1, people who are looking for a game that have more to offer compared to DOA 3 while be disappointed. Live and more costumes are of course great, but they're just the few things that keeps this from being a game no DOA 3 player should buy.<br\/> DOA 3 was much better, even without Live and many costumes. Luckily, unlocking the Booster in DOA Ultimate makes the experience on DOA 3 much better!<br\/> <br\/> I hope DOA 4 won't disappoint that much, but it's practically certain that it won't.<\/p>",

      "description": "<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"\">Grand Theft Auto III set the gaming world on fire when it came out in late 2001. It was hitherto one of the most violent and mature games ever released while creating an entirely new genre, the sandbox. All these years later, \u00a0it's still clear why this was a classic in the first place, but the dated presentation and some pacing issues make it feel slightly unpolished. As a result, GTA III doesn't feel quite as fresh as it did the day it came out, but it's still a whole lot of fun.<br\/><br\/>In Grand Theft Auto III, you take the role of an unnamed criminal who has been betrayed by his girlfriend accomplice and convicted of robbery. Fortunately, luck is on your side, and a group of professional criminals break you out of the armored car transporting you to jail for reasons you'll have to find out. From then on you're on your own in Liberty City (a city loosely based on New York City), and you'll have to find a way to stay afloat the only way you know how--with crime.<br\/><br\/>You can fulfill all of your wildest crime fantasies in Liberty City. Any car on the street is open game. You simply walk up to a car and press triangle to wrench the driver out and speed away. There are endless possibilities with this car-stealing mechanic. You can steal taxis and drive people around in a Crazy Taxi-style mini game to rack up cash, or you can steal cop cars and hunt down criminals vigilante-style. You'll also be able to get behind the wheel of an ambulance and try to get people to the hospital as fast as possible for some quick cash.<br\/><br\/>There's also lots of mayhem to be caused on foot. For example, you can start fights with anyone on the street. Whether you've got a baseball bat, a flame-thrower, or simply your bare fists, beating the living crap out of innocent civilians is always fun. There's always something to keep you occupied in Liberty City.<br\/><br\/>Liberty City is a mostly realistic atmosphere, so there are consequences for your actions. If you get out of hand and start running over too many people or try to steal a car right in front of a cop, you'll alert the police. At first you'll only have a one-star rating and the cops will forget about you if you outrun them. But once you get two or more stars, you won't be able to lose the cops unless you spend $1000 to repaint your car at the shop, making you unrecognizable to the cops. It's not like alerting the cops takes away from the fun though. Once you get farther in the game and you start getting chased by multiple cars and helicopters, it can be a blast trying to race the cops to your target before getting killed.<br\/><br\/>Although it's possible to spend hours causing random havoc in the streets of Liberty CIty, you're missing out on a lot of the fun if you don't progress in the story. Scattered across the mini-map in the bottom-left corner of the screen are markers that highlight spots where you can find new missions. Various people of power in Liberty City will give you loads of dough for you to do their dirty work.<br\/><br\/>Most missions involve some combination of stealing cars, retrieving and delivering packages, and wasting gangsters. You'll have to use your mini-map to get to your locations and do what you've been sent to do. The nature of the game encourages choices, and you'll be able to take out your targets in various ways. The quickest way to kill someone is to run them over, but if your target is in an area thats can't be reached by car, or they have enough firepower to blow up your car if you get too close, you'll have to resort to using weapons. You'll have a variety of different guns, including a pistol, some automatic machine guns, a sniper rifle, and eventually flame-throwers and rocket launchers. All of these weapons come in handy in different situations and it's a lot of fun figuring out the best way to take someone out. Every player completes missions differently, but as long as you earn the cash, it doesn't really matter how you get it done.<br\/><br\/>But what good would a whole bunch of dirty money be if you couldn't spend it? In each of the three islands of Liberty City there is a shop called Ammu-Nation where you'll be able to buy guns as well as grenades and armor. Even so, it's really difficult to get low on cash in the game. Besides buying weapons and paying one or two ransoms, you won't really have anything to spend your money on. As a result, you'll always have way more money than you need, and this makes the money you get for completing missions feel less important. It would've been more fun if cash was a little harder to come by, encouraging you to find other means of earning cash, like completing side missions or collecting taxi fares.<br\/><br\/>Most of these missions are pretty straight-forward, but the final few get cruelly difficult to the point of frustration. Once you fail a mission, you can't restart it unless you drive all the way back to the person who appointed it to you. Some of the harder missions are really long and drawn out, so you'll have to trudge through them multiples times and won't be able to retry them instantly. This becomes a problem in the final couple of missions where they pour loads of enemies on you and give you very few weapons to deal with them. It almost feels like a cheap way to lengthen the game, or just a poor decision all-around by Rockstar. These missions really detract from the experience if you're looking to complete the story without using cheats, because it's very easy to give up once you get stuck at this point.<br\/><br\/>The game's huge variety of music and fitting voice acting give it a lot of character. Whenever you get into a car you'll have a choice of several radio stations to listen to, including two talk stations. The genres range the entire gamut from classical to rap and everything in between. The talk radio stations are particularly entertaining, consisting entirely of spoofs based on racial and social stereotypes. The commercials have the same sort of satirical humor, advertising SUVs big enough to get lost in and outrageous weight loss programs involving electrocuting yourself in your sleep. Voices are also a highlight of the game. The gangsters you work for have thick New York accents and the different raced characters like the Colombians and Japanese also have fitting accents. The prostitute Maria that you'll be dealing with a lot in the game has a particularly memorable sassy voice that you'd expect from an overconfident and overpayed whore. It's also worth noting that the character you play as has no voice at all. This works out well, because it keeps the main character mysterious, but it also feels kind of odd since everyone else in the game has such a distinct personality.<br\/><br\/>While the sound is probably one of Grand Theft Auto III's greatest strengths, the graphics feel dated compared to today's standards. The world looks fairly realistic and the car models passable at best, but character models lack detail we've come to expect, like fingers and facial expressions. The colors also feel a little washed out. Most of the buildings are gray and a lot of the cars are dull shades of blue and red. The water in the game looks rather bland too -- it's basically a flat texture that sometimes moves up and down when it starts to rain. All in all, the most indicative sign of Grand Theft Auto III's age is its graphics, but in a game that's main focus is giving you a huge world to do what you want in, this really isn't that big of a deal.<br\/><br\/>All flaws aside, Grand Theft Auto III is still a classic, and this fact is evident even to people who are just now playing the game for their first time. The freedom Rockstar gave the player was unprecedented at the time, and although the missions could have been designed a little better (read: easier), this game is really fun no matter how you cut it. If you're looking for the best Grand Theft Auto experience you can find, you might want to start with the much improved upon sequels simply because they do the same thing this game does, but better. Otherwise, this is still a really fun game for any mature action fan and is well worth the five dollars or less it'll cost you.<\/span>",

      "description": "<p>Ninja Gaiden II. When I first saw the game, it looked promising and fun. The first Ninja Gaiden was a lot of fun to play and, what is perhaps, one of the most difficult games I've ever played.\u00a0 Despite being really difficult, it was one of the most gorgeous looking, and best playing games I've ever seen on the Xbox. With that said, there's a lot\u00a0 of anticipation and excitement for the sequel. For the most part, NInja Gaiden II is a good game, but it's has some issues that prevent it from being the awesome game that it could have been.<br\/><br\/>There's a story for Ninja Gaiden II, but like the first game, it doesn't really make any sense. If my mind serves me correctly, it involves this statue that's located in the Hayabusa village (that village never seems to get a break), is stolen by a group of fiends, led by Genshin and Elizabeta, to awaken a ancient evil (Sounds pretty stupid huh?). It's just an excuse to send Ryu Hayabusta, the hero from the first game, to different places around the world. While this may not be an issue for some gamers, it's stupid that the story isn't structured well and doesn't really give incentive to players that play\u00a0 games for the story to find out what happened next. But, you do see a chick with big boobs in the game and a naked woman (just eye candy for some adolescent boys).<br\/><br\/>Then again, the reason to play this game is the action. Just like Ninja Gaiden, the action is fast, fluid, and smooth. It has been raised up a notch from the first game. The biggest addition, visually,\u00a0 is dismemberment. Just slicing up body parts of your enemies is awesome to watch and watching blood splatter everywhere. One thing to consider, just because you sliced off their arms or legs, doesn't mean they're dead. The enemies will put up a fight and try to take you down. <br\/><br\/>The other change is the health system, which works differently than the last game. Health has two colours, red and blue. Blue represents you current health and red is permanent damage. If you can get out of the action, or finish a battle, your health will restore up to the red. Your health will restore completely when you save your game, which are more frequent now. The game also saves before a boss fight, so you don't have to worry about playing a section again before getting to the boss.<br\/><br\/>With that said, don't take that as being easy. This game is still difficult. There are two difficulty settings when you start off: Path of the Acolyte, and Path of the Warrior. The acolyte difficulty feels easier than it should be. Enemies are fairly easy to take down and boss battles can be beaten by using the same techniques over and over again. The warrior difficulty feels like the hard mode from the first Ninja Gaiden. The game is much more ruthless and, at a few points, really challenging. After you finish the game you'll unlock two more difficulties. However, the difficulty does feel unbalanced in a few areas, specifically in the middle section. That point the game becomes cheap, which the first game didn't do as much.<br\/><br\/>Another change is bosses. There are a lot of them now, and they vary from great to terrible. Some boss battles are fun to fight, such as in a arena. There are a few that are hard, and one that is cheap. That boss (SPOILER), after you take him down, he will explode and take you with him. There's one boss that you battle four times, which is repetitive and seems that the developers couldn't think of any other interesting end level boss fights. While more boss fights are great, and I'm all for it for the challenge, make the battles balanced. <br\/><br\/>In terms of presentation, the game looks good, but isn't much of an advancement from the first Ninja Gaiden. The character models still look impressive and dismember well. The animations are still sharp, but seem to skip once in a while. The blood, while good and excessive, is flat and static. This is most evident when you see a blood splatter on the edge of a wall or floor. It just sits there floating, that's not very impressive. The environments are varied from beautiful, to just downright ugly. The camera in the game has been changed in this game, and it isn't very good. The camera has a tendency to get stuck in places and focuses at the wrong places. This is most evident in tight corridors. Another unusual issue the frame rate, which tends to drop when there are a lot of enemies or effects going on. This wasn't an issue in the first game, so it sticks out here.<br\/><br\/>The audio is good, but nothing to write home about. The voice work is decent and comes with the choice of English and Japanese track. The music is decent and does a good job of getting you in the action. Sound effects if forceful and effective. The connection of blade to flesh just sounds so good, it scary. <br\/><br\/><b>Final Opinion: <\/b>Now, with all that said, Ninja Gaiden II is a good game. But compared to it's competitor, Devil May Cry 4, this game is just harder. If you were a fan of the first game, you will have fun with this one. If you're new to the series, proceed with some caution.<br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">On the off chance that you don't already know, Medal of Honor is the World War II first person shooter developed by EA. In its long running history, this franchise has seen its high points and its low points in its nearly 10 year, 10+ title life-cycle. Medal of Honor: Vanguard continues the well-established framework and plays out much as you would expect it too. Unfortunately, it also shares much in common with its predecessor, European Assault. Though to some this might not be a bad thing, one cannot deny the flaws that seem to be embedded in the tired out gameplay. Through the plethora of available World War II series, one usually finds oneself drawn to one franchise or another. So if you have chosen Medal of Honor as your WWII FPS of choice, then you will get that fix from this installment. <br\/><br\/>The game puts you in the role of (soon to be) Sergeant Keegan as he propels a team from the 82nd Airborne through countless hostile battlefields desperately trying to turn the tide of war. You will get that same system of broad chapters divided up into various missions that has become the norm for the series. Each chapter is accompanied by a nifty black and white video that one would think is real footage from the war. The first drawback of the game is that it is incredibly and unacceptably too short. You can finish this game in the ballpark of 5 to 10 hours depending on how good you are. Basically you can finish it in one sitting and no game should be that short. It isn't so much that its easy, because you can adjust the difficulty, its just that there are four chapters and between 2 and 3 missions in each. That equals out to a short game indeed. But in that short time, you will find all that makes Medal of Honor, well Medal of Honor.<br\/><br\/>The gameplay doesn't change much from the other installments. There are slight changes and improvements but nothing of note worth putting down. Basically you must plow your way through hordes of soldiers by using cover and a heck of a good aim. Most of the time you will be assisted by a group of allies, though they really don't do much in the way of assisting. They have a terrible shot so most of the mowing down must come from you. They do shout out enemy positions and give some advice for taking cover, but this isn't all together that useful anyways so if all else fails they make good cover. Along the way you will become intimately acquainted with what MG42s and Tigers are if you don't already know. There is a vary limited number of different weapons available and only one is customized by means of adding a scope to it and that is very late in the game. All the shortcomings aside, Vanguard delivers a shooter experience that you would expect and tells a good tale, even if it is a short one.<br\/><br\/>The one real shining spot for the game, and this has been the shining spot in the series, is the music. It just simply does an incredible job of making it feel more like a motion picture experience then just a video game. All in all, the sound in general does a good job. Everything from the firing of weapons to the shouts of your comrades sound great and really do well to put you in the scene. Though the sound f x themselves hardly redefine the genre, the music is always an exceptional score and does much to add to your experience. <br\/><br\/>Though it doesn't do what Frontline did for the series back in the day, it is a Medal of Honor game through and through. You will get what you expect from the game and even though it is short, you will finish the game feeling satisfied. If you are one of the series loyal legionnaires, you will get that one simply exceptional level that always seems to be somewhere in each game. This coupled with the fantastic score makes this yet another iteration in the growing franchise that is Medal of Honor. It proves that this tired out old framework still has some juice left in it. The game receives a 6 out of 10 from my system, which puts it at \"Fun.\" After all, like all good Medal of Honor games, you won't have to wait to long for the price to fall to the very attractive 19.99 point, and what else can you buy that is as satisfying as a WWII shooter for 20 bucks?<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>The Burnout series has always been about one thing: pushing your limits while driving in traffic with your engine spitting out nitro. This time around, it's about making your opponents crash. When you for example push an opponent to the front of a bus, \"BUS TAKEDOWN\" will pop up on your screen while you see your opponents car being smashed in slow-motion. However the camera will for a couple of seconds not concentrate on your car, but your opponents car. If you were to crash in a wall before the camera switched angle, your car would just park with its nose against the wall. This can also happen if you were heading straight to the front of a vehicle. But if you were going fast enough, the vehicle would take off on your hood as if you were a moving ramp. This is incredibly cool and definitely makes you feel extremely lucky.<br\/> <br\/> But if you do crash, you can pull of a trick called \"aftertouch\". This means that you can steer your car in slow-motion by using your remaining nitro. If you then make an opponent crash into you, you've done an \"Aftertouch Takedown\". This can also save the section of nitro you'll normally lose, while adding to your total takedowns.<br\/> <br\/> Your amount of nitro is increased by driving like an idiot. Driving in oncoming traffic, drifting, near-misses (barely dodging traffic) and tailing (drafting) are some of the things you can do to add nitro. When you do a takedown, your Nito \"meters\" limit of Nitro is doubled while filling it completely. You can continue this till it's 4 times the size you started with. When you crash you lose the last section of Nitro you gained(from 4x to 3x, 3x to 2x or 2x to 1x).<br\/> <br\/> Being lucky is another thing. It's the main aspect of the game. how you can dodge several big vehicles while drifting in an corner, for example, or managing to press your car under a huge semi-trailer while crossing a junction because an opponent crashed in it before you so the semi-trailer lifted a couple of centimeters above ground. Stuff like that...<br\/> <br\/> Another thing is the \"Signature Takedowns\". This is a normal takedown, but you must do it in a special way. If you send an opponent flying near luxury boats in the Vineyard, you'll get an Signature Takedown called \"Berth Trauma\". There's 20 Signature Takedowns in the game, and by doing all of these you'll unlock an NASCAR-looking car.<br\/> <br\/> There's a total of 67 cars in the game. These are divided into different series. You'll start off with a Compact car. As you progress in the game you'll unlock more Compact cars and eventually unlock the next series. This continues until you've unlocked the Super cars and some of the Special cars. The special cars are cars that don't fit in a series. Two of these are taken from Burnout 2, three are F1 racers(although one has different design). and then there's the NASCAR-looking car. There's another series, but it's only for Crash events.<br\/> <br\/> Crash events are even more crazy and fun then in Burnout and Burnout 2. In Burnout 3 there's several symbols you can collect. These range from Instant Boost to 2x Multiplier to Heartbreaker (your score is cut in half) to 4x Multiplier. Head into traffic and cause as much damage you can. Yet another thing is the \"Chrashbreaker\". When enough vehicles are impacted in the Crash, an single button will make a bomb go of in your car, causing damage to vehicles around you. The Crashbreaker is also an collectable symbol. There's a massive 100 Crash events in the game. Causing enough damage unlocks cars in the Heavyweight series. These cars range from a 4x4 to the extreme Fire Truck, which can be obtained by winning all the 10 headlines. Headlines are won by getting a such a massive score that you get on the frontpage in the local newspaper.<br\/> <br\/> The coolest mode in Burnout 3 is the Road Rage mode. It's not about coming first, but about doing as many Takedowns you can until your car can't continue anymore. Your opponents boost when you boost, and do there best to stay close to you.<br\/> <br\/> The Live functions are great and all you need for a good experience.<br\/> <br\/> The worst thing about the game is the standard soundtrack. Although the Xbox version has Custom Soundtracks, the rest have no other choice but to like the punk music. Unless you like that kind of music, multiplatformers should choose the Xbox version.<br\/> <br\/> The game is great for anyone who want instant fun, or a challenge for those who want to complete the game. It's not as easy as it sounds, but you can always take a brake and have fun in a Single Race. Racing games that claims to be fun, will have trouble beating this racer.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\">Star Trek: Conquest may be many things, but an excellent game it is not. In a world of horrible console based RTS games, Bethesda decides they will use their Star Trek license to put forth a game that is unique, but all together unimpressive. Your first clue to this fact might be the price tag. Clocking in at a very attractive 14.99 price point (Unless you ask GameStop who tacks on 5 extra dollars because they love money!) you really can't expect much and the very fact that the game is so ridiculously cheap makes it not really that bad of an offer, even for a sub-par game. For your pennies, you get a nifty sim experience rolled up with a feel of RTS.<br\/><br\/>Calling this title an RTS might be a little generous. In actuality it is more of a, um well let me just describe it for you. The game features two modes: Campaign and Skirmish. Campaign is the main source of fun here in which you take control of one of six factions, Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Cardassian, Dominion, or Breen and pit them against one or all of the rest in a turn based galactic domination style playing experience. This mode is mainly defined by a map with a bunch of planets on it. Everyone takes turns building, moving, and conquering. It's very simple to understand and jump right into. You get money at the beginning of each turn depending on the number of planets and mining facilities that you have. This money is good for constructing star bases, gun fortifications, mining facilities or research facilities. The main thing that will be using up your cash flow however is the fleet construction. Basically you can hire up to three fleet commanders. After ponying up for the commission of the commanders themselves, you then buy up to seven ships for each of their fleets. After you are satisfied with what you have, you go forth and attempt to capture planets and destroy enemy fleets to take control of the entire galaxy. <br\/><br\/>Mining facilities are good for money, but the other option is the research facility. These are handy for two things. The first is the special weapon, which is a choice of constructing one of three items that depends on which race you play as. These can do things such as isolate one planet so that enemy commanders can't get through, healing a system, cutting a system's health down by half. (meaning that any star bases, facilities, or fleets located there lose half their HP) or various other small affects to give you a slight advantage. Secondly, research facilities do research. Each race has five different characteristics that can be upgraded through research. These characteristics can be upgraded a total of three times per characteristic and vary from taking the price of ships down slightly to boosting efficiency on mining or research facilities, to even increasing ship attack power or HP. Both the special weapon and the upgrades take a certain number of turns before they can be used. The number of turns depends completely on the number of research facilities you own. Therefore it is possible to have a special weapon ready for each of your turns.<br\/><br\/>The extra draw for the game lies in the combat mechanic. When your fleet comes across into contact with an enemy fleet or an enemy structure, battle ensues. The battling itself can be done in one of three way: Instant, Sim, or Arcade. Instant is handy if you are confident enough that you will win the battle. Basically the computer randomly decides what happens and the battle is instantly over. Sim is a more traditional form where you see photons fired and phasers shot. This mode adds the ability to have your commanders take an offensive, defensive, or neutral battle plan and has the added ability of withdrawing (only if you initiated the attack) which can be handy so you don't lose your commander's experience, which is reduced to zero when they are completely defeated. Both of these modes pale in comparison to the last mode option, arcade. This puts you in actual command of a ship in a battlefield. You can move, target, fire, and basically free to take control of the battle from the front seat. This mode is very difficult but can be worth it if your good enough. The play experience here isn't all that exciting but it is a nice addition to an otherwise unimaginative gaming atmosphere.<br\/><br\/>All this aside, lets talk about the drawbacks. They are described quite well in one word, limited. Everything is very limited. Each race can only have a maximum of three fleets at any time. That's it! This makes it incredibly time consuming and gives the game more of that give an inch take and inch tug of war feeling. Another limitation is ships construction itself. There are only three classes of ship construction, light, medium and heavy. Also, each planet that you control has only two slots for construction, the first being reserved for either standard or advance star bases, and the second for either a mining facility or research facility and that's it. The gameplay is repetitive, the races don't seem well balanced, and all in all the game just feels like it missed something. However, these drawbacks aside it is a 15 dollar game, perhaps even less by the time you read this. Plus the game is fun, for a little bit at least. So if you want to support 15 dollar games coming out, really if you would rather pay 15 dollars and get a disc in your hands as apposed to paying for a virtual download game, then by all means support this cause. That's why I bought it. Final score is a 6 out of 10 putting it at \"Fun\" but if there was a special achievement for value, Star Trek: Conquest would earn that as well.<\/span><\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><span class=\"yui-non\"><\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Burnout Paradise is Criterion's 5th Burnout game, and the first built from the ground up for this console generation. It's apparent from the first moment you get behind the wheel, not just from the bump up in graphics, but\u00a0 also the complete lack of loading screens.<br\/><br\/>It's a major change, which requires an adjustment in how you attack the game. The game's much less arcade-like now, taking the fashionable sandbox approach instead. Events appear on your HUD and world map once you discover them at individual locations. Drive up to the traffic lights, pull a doughnut to activate that junction's event and away you go. These range from the standard races and classic Road Rages to the new Marked Man, a point-to-point chase where the rest of the field are out to shut you down before the finish line.<br\/><br\/>No event has a set course, you're given an end point and it's up to you to get there first anyway you can. This can be a problem in the early stages as you slowly learn the layout of Paradise City. A wrong turn can lose you a race, and there's no quick restart option, other than to drive back to the start line. Once you've know your way around this becomes less of a problem, as there are also plenty of handy shortcuts. This has its own downside though, as it further breaks up the pack. One of Burnout's hallmarks is paint-scrapingly close races and frequent takedowns, which are much prevalent here.<br\/><br\/>The other noteable feature has always been the Crash Junction, a welcome change of pace which still kept the carnage levels up. This was almost a puzzle mini-game in previous games, with a set junction, vehicle and target score. In Paradise this has become Showtime mode, where you can flip your car out at any time to rack up a score. These wrecks can be extended almost indefintely, but with no set target score it feels a little pointless.<br\/><br\/>None of this is enough to spoil what is still one of the best racing franchises around, though. If you fail one event there are always plenty of other events (or cars) to try, and no other game gives the same feeling of sheer speed. Online races are smooth and easy to access in-real time fron the d-pad. As ever Burnout is deeper than it appears and rewards even after weeks of play.<br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>So just to start i am a huge Dragonball z fan, as it was the first Anime that i ever saw back when it was first shown on Cartoon Network but this Burst Limit review will not be swaided by that fact like alot of these other reviews have.<br\/> <br\/> So on to the Review!!!<br\/> <br\/> People seem to compare this game with Budokai 3 alot for some reason, even after playing it, this is wrong as it shouldn't be compared with 3 but with Budokai 1.<br\/> <br\/> I'm proberly right in guessing that if your reading ( or have read ) this review then you are interested in some form in either Dragonball z itself or fighting games. Well...<br\/> First off Dragonball z Burst Limit for the Xbox 360\/PS3 is a Primary fighting game, and a good one at that.<br\/> <br\/> Now unlike the past few DBZ games, Burst Limit return to the Budokai formula of fighting as the camera is places further out and not behind your character like the Tenkaichi series, and just like the Budokai series<br\/> the game focuses more on strict fighting instead of collecting capsules and Dragon Balls for your character. After completing story sequences, you unlock certain items such as characters, abilities and battle stages. Combat has been simplified dramatically from the previous games. Using special moves is as easy as pressing a button and moving the left analog stick or d-pad simultaneously. If certain actions are made during the battle, \"Drama Pieces\" are activated, causing many different effects such as having your health restored with a Senzu Bean and a helper character attacking your opponent.<br\/> <br\/> Now these '' Drama Pieces '' are what i would call a '' double edged sword '' for the sheer fact that when you first play the game and activate one of these Drama pieces, it looks cool thanks to the great Animation ( exept the mouths that keep moving after the dialogue has been said ) and core graphics, but after completing the game you would of most proberly unlocked 80% of these Drama pieces which means you can use them if equipped to your character in fights online or against friends, thats good and everything, until you have seen and activated the same Drama piece OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, which again would be fine......<br\/> <br\/> IF YOU COULD SKIP THEM !!!!!!!!!!!!<br\/> <br\/> Although implemented fairly well these Drama Pieces turn from being a great addition to being a hindrance during gameplay and although what alot of reviews said is true in the way that '' They dont really determine who wins '' it still fells rather disjointed enough to make the game abit of a chore.<br\/> <br\/> Now aswell as noticing these unlocked Drama pieces during the story who'll also notice the story itself fell abit ( or hugely ) disjointed from pretty much the previous animation scene...<br\/> E.G. in one particular scene Goku fights freiza for a while and finally comes to a desition that the only course of action would be to use the Spirit Bomb, only a second after Goku saying this the Scene jumps to Goku Firing it ......<br\/> <br\/> So what happened to Gohan , Krillin, and piccolo fighting freiza long enough for Goku to gather enough energy?<br\/> Makes me wonder if anyone from Atari even watched the Anime or if they just saw bits of it during Adverts.<br\/> <br\/> Anothering thing as well as skipping fights altogether, '' What if '' fights have been added ( For some stupid reason ) one of these '' what if '' fights include Bardock fighting all of the main Z fighters until he fights Goku.<br\/> Now i cant really complain about the core game play, but why in the hell skip important fights that were really in the anime and put in this crap?<br\/> <br\/> Also within the story mode you will unlock all 20 or so of the fighters within Dragonball z Burst Limit, for this ive heard both arguments...<br\/><br\/> '' ONLY 20 CHARACTERS?... THATS **** ''<br\/><br\/>and<br\/><br\/>' There may be only 20 characters but they all play differently now ''<br\/><br\/>I have found out that both of these statements are utter crap.<br\/> Yes I'll admit the hand to hand combat is different for around 17 characters but the special attacks are something far different....<br\/> E.G. Yamcha, Goku, Krillin and Gohan all have the same special attack, the KAMEHAMEHA!<br\/> So how can every character play differently if they each have the same DAMN ATTACK.<br\/><br\/>Of course aswell as the stroy mode Burst Limit offers a few other features for you to pretty much waste your time in, these features are:<br\/> <br\/> Survival Mode: A mode where you keep fighting opponents ( 100 ) as long as your health lasts.<br\/> <br\/> Time Attack Mode: A mode where you fight a specific set of opponents and try to beat them as quickly as possible.<br\/> <br\/> Battle Point Mode: A mode where you fight a specific set of opponents and try to score as many points as possible.<br\/> <br\/> Now apart from some good leaderboard options to see who has the best in each mode, these are pretty terrible for 3 main reasons:<br\/> <br\/> 1. There all pretty much the same thing but one with a set of health, another with time and the last with a point average.<br\/> <br\/> 2. As there is 100 opponents on the survival Mode and only 20 character within the game its highly repeatitive.<br\/> <br\/> 3. Unskipable Drama Pieces Oh not only does Burst Limit screw you over with content but it also screws you over with it's online ( from my point of view anyway ) as just like Gamespot stated in there review it's core online feature is 1 Vs. 1 fighting, which it good and all considering alot of fighting games only have this feature, but what makes it far worse than them games would be the LAG during fights, if your opponent is across sea's...<br\/> So be Warned....<br\/> <br\/> Overall Dragonball Z Burst Limit IS a good fighter, with improved Graphics and gameplay but where it shines brightly in Flash and flair it seriously lacks in substance, so much so that it feels this game is the first DBZ ever on consoles, However if you are like me a fighting game fan and a dbz fan you will get a few kicks out of this.<br\/> <br\/> The Good:<br\/> <br\/> Nice visuals<br\/> Drama pieces start off being a nice touch<br\/> easy learning curve<br\/> <br\/> The Bad:<br\/> <br\/> not worth the \u00a340 i payed<br\/> depends on whether you like Eng Dub<br\/> Drama Pieces annoy you after a period <br\/><br\/><br\/> The Ugly:<br\/><br\/>Online suffers from relentless Lag \t\t  \t\t   <br\/><br\/><br\/><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Infinity Ward has finished with the World War II era and has finally embraced a modern twist. The game brings the superb gameplay of past Call of Duty games and throws in a crazy blend of more technologically advanced weaponry and a new refined story to match-- and it works extremely well.<br\/> <br\/> Call of Duty 4 has one of the most interesting singe-player campaigns in a FPS. The single-player will put you in the shoes of a British S.A.S soldier and a American Marine, each with their own story where shocking events will arise along with some seriously jaw-dropping moments. The campaign will leave you out of breadth from the very start to the very end--no matter how short it may be. The campaign is frustratingly short for such an excellent story, most gamers accustomed to FPS will be able to compete the campaign in around five hours on the easier difficulty. Needless to say, the action and gameplay make the short campaign a very enjoyable experience.<br\/> <br\/> The gameplay in Call of Duty 4 is very much like previous Call of Duty games. You have a compass at the bottom left of the screen with objectives marked and you must make your way to these objectives with your AI controlled comrades. Something Call of Duty 4 does very well is your interactivity with your team, each man has their own personality and will offer tactical information on enemy positions and help you in completing your objectives. Your objectives will take you deep into enemy territory in the Middle-East repelling rebel ambushes and to the cold of Russia partaking in Special Ops missions. Even though the campaign is painstakingly short, you'll not want the experience to end there.<br\/> <br\/> However the excellent multiplayer certainly makes up for the lack of singleplayer action. Up to 18 players can get into a match on one of 16 equally different maps varying for a more sniper-friendly landscape to wild grenade pounding and manic shooting maps. There are also six game maps to choose from. There is the familiar team death match and free-for-all deathmatch, also the more objective orientated maps like headquarters. Call of Duty 4 also gives players the choice to tackle more hardcore modes like disabling the HUD but making weapons more powerful-- if you dare to try these modes.<br\/> <br\/> The multiplayer adds more tactical abilities for the skilled players among you. For three kills you will be granted UAV support which will highlight all enemy position on your HUD, for 5 kills you will receive an airstrike on any position on the map, and finally if you reach a seven kill streak without dying you will receive helicopter support for a period of time. This helicopter is AI controlled but will circle the map shooting down any enemies it comes into contact with, though enemies can shoot it down but it will take a fair beating before it does. All these add a little more variety to online play and gives you some rewards for owning the battlefield.<br\/> <br\/> Playing the multiplayer does not go without rewards. Every time you get a kill, capture an objective, call in air support and completing challenges gives you experience which will help you to rise up the military ranks in multiplayer. Ranking up will unlock various weapons and challenges to complete which will help you gain a lot of XP points to go toward ranking up.<br\/> <br\/> The class feature on Call of Duty 4 is also very interesting. Each class has their own pros and cons, much like the classes in Call of Duty 3. However Infinity Ward have evolved this and added perks to these classes which offer some variety to them. As you rank up you will have the ability to create your own class. This allows you to pick your primary weapon, your sidearm, weapon attachments, what grenades you carry and 3 perks. The perks are split into 3 categories to which you can choose and you can unlock more perks as you rank higher. This system gives some variety to the game as no player rarely has the exact same character and offers a wide variety to create a class which suits your style of play.<br\/> <br\/> The perks system is very customisable. Perk number 1 is orientated around explosives, letting you choose from RPGs, claymores and even more frag or flashbang grenades. The other perks are more miscellaneous, but never-the-less important. They include cool things like increased ammunition, the ability to hold your breadth longer when sniping and dropping a live grenades as you die. The different perks vary for what ever tactics you choose to opt for but is great fun mixing and matching between each perk.<br\/> <br\/> Not only does Call of Duty 4 have an exciting singleplayer and multiplayer, but it also has top class graphics. Levels are beautifully rendered, especially those in the Middle-East and effects such as explosions and smoke are superbly crafted to near perfection. Even the multiplayer maps are stunning and full of life-- or what was left of it. The sound value of Call of Duty 4 is also top-notch. Guns sound crisp and realistically terrifying, explosions are also equally scary and you really feel like you're in the middle of a battle, fighting for your life. The voice acting is great too from the humorous banter of your squad in the cutscenes to the serious cries of communication during gameplay.<br\/> <br\/> Call of Duty 4 is an excellent FPS with a superb, but speedy singleplayer campaign, however the multiplayer is where the heart of the game is. It offers plenty of choice and is a lot of fun to play from exciting modes and maps which will keep you entertained for a very long time to come.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>I would like to start off by saying that I really respect Epic Games when it comes to producing value for money games for all of us. They are amongst a small group of developers that really put their heart and soul into everything they release and it shows with Unreal Tournament 3.<br\/><br\/>UT3 is all about action packed, fast combat with jaw dropping visuals and killer sound to boot. The visuals in UT3 are fantastic and the game runs at a blistering framerate with no slowdown to be found even in the heaviest of battles.<br\/><br\/>From the character models to the stunning battle grounds, UT3 looks the part from all angles. The weapons although not realistic feel great and are so accurate that every other developer (besides Activision) should study this game and take notes on how to make a first person shooter.<br\/><br\/>Unreal Tournament has never been known for its story and UT3 is no exception. The story is shocking, you will find yourself skipping the majority of this as I did, it just does not have any weight at all, pity.<br\/><br\/>Where UT3 shines is in its gameplay and more specifically in Multiplayer! Multiplayer action is fantastic. Once you find yourself a good ping and a good group of people online, you will have a blast. There are a heap of multiplayer modes to choose from but from what I have played it looks like team deathmatch is the most popular.<br\/><br\/>The sound in UT3 is very good although the comments made by other players like \u201cyeah, take that!\u201d do get a little annoying after a while.<br\/><br\/>If you\u2019re after a shooter that is hardcore in nature but easy to pick up and play, this is the game for you.<br\/><br\/><span style=\"color:rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size:130%; \"><span style=\"font-weight:bold; \">Gameplay = 8.5<\/span><br\/><span style=\"font-weight:bold; \">Visuals = 8.5<\/span><br\/><span style=\"font-weight:bold; \">Sound = 7.5<\/span><br\/><span style=\"font-weight:bold; \">Game Now Score = 8.3\/10<\/span><\/span><br\/>http:\/\/gamenowsleeplater.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/unreal-tournament-3-review.html<br\/><\/p>",
